            Your task is to perform the following actions: 


            Now, read the following verilog code delimited by 
              <>
              Code: <{instructions}>
            write a list of all the state transitions for this design. donot consider default state here.
            for example:
            List: A List of state transitions is given:
            Reset: X
            X -> Y
            Y -> Y or M
            M -> M
            Connection Analysis:
            State X: No of incoming transitions = 1, No of outgoing transitions = 1 and outgoing connected state = Y 
            State Y: No of incoming transitions = 1, No of outgoing transitions = 2 and outgoing connected states are Y or M 
            State M: No of incoming transitions = 1, No of outgoing transitions = 1 and outgoing connected state is M 

            while giving response, only write Connection Analysis in the following format delimited by []
            for example:
            [Connection Analysis:]
