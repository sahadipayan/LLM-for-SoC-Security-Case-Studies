                Your task is to perform the following actions: 
                Now, read the list of state transitions delimited by <>
                  List: <{instructions}>

                Analyze all the states one by one and find if there is any state that fulfils following three conditions:
                Condition 1. The has at least one incoming state transition, 
                Condition 2. The state has only one outgoing state transition, 
                Condition 3. The state and its outgoing connected state are same

                For example: 
                State P1: No of incoming transitions = 2, No of outgoing transitions = 2 and outgoing connected states are P2 or P3
                State P2: No of incoming transitions = 1, No of outgoing transitions = 1 and outgoing connected state is P1
                State P3: No of incoming transitions = 1, No of outgoing transitions = 2 and outgoing connected state is P1 OR P4
                State P4: No of incoming transitions = 1, No of outgoing transitions = 1 and outgoing connected state is P4
                State P5: No of incoming transitions = 0, No of outgoing transitions = 1 and outgoing connected state is P5


                Analysis for this example:
                +-------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
                | State | Condition 1 | Condition 2 | Condition 3 |
                +-------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
                | P1    | Satisfied   | Not Satisfied | Not Satisfied |
                +-------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
                | P2    | Satisfied   | Satisfied   | Not Satisfied |
                +-------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
                | P3    | Satisfied   | Not Satisfied | Not Satisfied |
                +-------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
                | P4    | Satisfied   | Satisfied   | Satisfied   |
                +-------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
                | P5    | Not Satisfied | Satisfied   | Satisfied   |
                +-------+-------------+-------------+-------------+


                Perform similar analysis on given list of state transitions.
