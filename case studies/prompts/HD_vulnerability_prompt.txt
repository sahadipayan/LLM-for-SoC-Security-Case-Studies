Your task is to perform the following actions: 
    
Now, read the following verilog code delimited by 
    <>
Code: <{nput Design}>

In this case, assume WAIT KEY is the protected state, and other states are unprotected.
There are two security rules:
1. All unused states of a control FSM should be handled through the ‘default’ statement in the RTL description
2. When state transition takes place between two consecutive unprotected states, the hamming distance between the states should be 1.

Security Assessment:

These two rules are violated in this design in the following way:
1. The is no ‘default’ statement through which unused states `101’, `110’, and `111’ are handled.
2. There are following two state transitions between unprotected states where the hamming distance is not 1.
WAIT DATA - INDIAL ROUND : 001 - 010 : HD=2 DO ROUND - FINAL ROUND: 011 - 100: HD=3

Violation Mitigation Instructions:

Modify the FSM design so that the rules are followed. While modification the STG graph remains the same. For the modified design, check if is there any rule violation in the provided design. If yes, continue modifying until two rules are followed in the modified design.
