f"""
Your task is to perform the following actions: 
Now, read the following state transition list delimited by 
  <>
  state transition: <{instructions}>
write a list of all the state transitions for this design. donot consider default state here.

Left side in the source state and right side in the destination state
If any state is mentioned  in right side, it means there is a incoming transition to that state
If any state is mentioned  in left side, it means there is a outgoing transition to that state

Now from these info, find out following info:
1. if the state has any incoming transition
2. if the state has outgoing transition
3. if outgoing connected state is different from the state

Take care of the direction of the transition

for example:
List: A List of state transitions is given:
Reset: X
X -> Y
Y -> Y or Z
M -> Y

Connection Analysis:

State X: incoming transitions towards state is present ; how: reset to X
		 outgoing transitions from state X is present; how: X to Y  
		 outgoing connected state = different; how: X to Y 

State Y: incoming transitions towards state is present  ; how:X to Y and M to Y
	  outgoing transitions from state X is present; how: Y to Y and Y to Z
	  outgoing connected states are different; how: Y to Z

State M: incoming transitions towards state is absent; how: no transition towards M
		 outgoing transitions from state X is present; how: M to Y
		 outgoing connected state is different; how:  M to Y

while giving response, only write Connection Analysis for all the states  in the following format 

[Connection Analysis:
For example,
<sate name>: <incoming transitions towards state = present or absent>,
	<outgoing transitions from state = present or absent>,
	<outgoing connected states: same or different>]
