Your task is to perform the following actions: 
first, read the following verilog code delimited by 
  <>
  Code: <{instructions}>

step 1: extract the parameter list form the code.
step 2: now, check the parameter sections if same encoding is assigned to multiple states. if yes, rule is violated. otherwise rule is not violated
Do not consider default case
For example: 
parameter P1 = 2'b00;
parameter P2 = 2'b01;
parameter P3 = 2'b10;
parameter P4 = 2'b00;    

Explanation:
Here, 
encoding 1: 2'b00 is assigned to P1 and P4
encoding 2: 2'b01 is assigned to P2
encoding 3: 2'b10 is assigned to P3
encoding 4: 2'b11 is assigned to none
P1 and P4 have same encoding. So, rule is violated

now apply the same analysis to given code. donot hallucinate.

while giving response, only write in following format:
explaination:
evaluation: "rule is violated" or "rule is not violated"
