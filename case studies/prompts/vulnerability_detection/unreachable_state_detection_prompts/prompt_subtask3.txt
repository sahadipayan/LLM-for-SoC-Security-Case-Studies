Now, read the information about transitions delimited by <>
  List: <{instructions}>

which state has satisfies all of these conditions:
Condition 1 incoming transition towards state should be absent. There should be no incoming state
Condition 2  outgoing transition from state should be present.
Condition 3. outgoing connected state is different.

Is there any such state that satisfies all 3 conditions? then, "unreachable state is present". Otherwise "unreachable state is absent"

reevaluate the task. If there is any error, correct it

while giving response write in the following format: 

explanation: 
state_name : which condition it satisfies 
decision: "unreachable state is present" or "unreachable state is absent"
