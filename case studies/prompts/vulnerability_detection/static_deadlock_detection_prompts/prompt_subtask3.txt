            Your task is to perform the following actions: 
            Now, read the table delimited by <>
              Table: <{instructions}>

            Analyze the table row by row.
            Now find if there is any state that fulfils all the  three conditions. if yes, static deadlock is present

            For example: 
            +-------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
            | State | Condition 1 | Condition 2 | Condition 3 |
            +-------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
            | P1    | Satisfied   | Not Satisfied | Not Satisfied |
            +-------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
            | P2    | Satisfied   | Satisfied   | Not Satisfied |
            +-------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
            | P3    | Satisfied   | Not Satisfied | Not Satisfied |
            +-------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
            | P4    | Satisfied   | Satisfied   | Satisfied   |
            +-------+-------------+-------------+-------------+
            | P5    | Not Satisfied | Satisfied   | Satisfied   |
            +-------+-------------+-------------+-------------+

            Explantion: 
            P1: does not satisfy condition 2 and 3
            P2: does not satisfy condition 3
            P3: does not satisfy condition 2 and 3
            P4 satisfies all the conditions. 
            P5: does not satisfy condition 1

            So, P4 satisfies all conditions. deadlock is present in P5.

            while giving response write in the following format: 
            explanation: 
            decision: "deadlock is present" or "deadlock is absent"
               """
