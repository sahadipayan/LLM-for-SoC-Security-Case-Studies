                Now, read the following verilog code delimited by 
                  <>
                  Code: <{input_design}>
                modify the code by introducing/adding a static deadlock state to the existing state transitions in the case statement. 
                static deadlock means when the fsm enters to that state from another state, it will not be able to come out from that state    
                To do this,
                step 1: from parameter list, first select initial state from state transition graph 
                step 2: change its state transition in the combinational block so that it connects to a new state called dealock_state
                step 3: first add new dealock_state state in case statement that has a self connecting loop

                before deadlock:
                parameter X=3'b000, Y=3'b001, Z=3'b011; 
                 case(current_state) 
                     X: begin
                        next_state=Y;
                     end

                    Y: begin
                      next_state=Z;
                    end

                    Z: begin
                      next_state=X;
                    end

                 endcase

                after deadlock:
                case(current_state) 
                    X: begin
                     if (start)
                     next_state=Y;
                     else
                        next_state=deadlock_state;     // step1: among existing states (X,Y,Z), initial state X is selected step2: X is connceted to deadlock state

                     end

                    Y: begin
                      next_state=Z;
                    end

                    Z: begin
                      next_state=X; 
                    end 

                    deadlock_state: begin
                      next_state=deadlock_state; //adding a deadlock state (step3)
                    end
                 endcase

                here, when X transits to deadlock_state, fsm cannot come out of it. always implement deadlock state in case statement. donot modify the sequential memory block

                Make sure all the three steps are followed
                donot implement deadlock_state in sequential always block, it should be in the case statement block         
                explanation: how and which line in the code, step 1, step2, step 3 have been followed. tell me the line no also where step 1, 2 and 3 has been implemented.
                review1:have you changed initial state? if not, rewrite the whole code
                review2:have you implemented step 2 in the case statement block.if not, rewrite the whole code by case statement block as shown in example]
                
                check if there is any syntax error in modified cose. correct the syntax eeor.
                also, modify the code and take care of the foolowing things:
                        1. donot use asterisk @(*) or @* in sensitivity list in any of the always blocks
                        2. donot use "end;", use "end"
                        3. for multiple statement always use begin..end. specially in default case
                        4. mark clock signal as 'clk' and reset signal as 'reset' in the corrected code
                        5. make the module name "fsm_module"
                        6. use parameter instead of local parameter
                        7. use current_state for present state, next_state for next state.
                        8. put semicolon after declaration of reg
                        9. put semicolon at the end of each statement
                        10. remove unnecessary comments
                        
                while giving response, only write  in the following format delimited by []

                [code: modified_code]
