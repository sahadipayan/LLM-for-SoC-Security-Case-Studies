Hardware Trojan: No

Security Analysis: 

1. aes_128: The main module takes in a clock signal, a 128-bit state, a 128-bit key and produces a 128-bit output. It first XORs the state and the key and then undergoes multiple rounds of encryption using the expand_key_128 and one_round modules. The final round uses the final_round module. No apparent Trojan in this module.

2. expand_key_128: This module is used to generate round keys for AES encryption. It takes in a clock signal, 128-bit input, 8-bit rcon, and gives out two 128-bit keys. The input key is divided into four 32-bit keys and then undergoes several XOR operations to generate the round keys. There doesn't appear to be any Trojan in this module.

3. one_round: This module is not shown in the provided code. However, it is assumed to perform one round of AES encryption which includes steps like SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey. Without seeing the implementation it's hard to say if there is any Trojan.

4. final_round: This module is also not provided in the code. It probably performs the final round of AES encryption which is similar to the regular round but without the MixColumns step. Without seeing the implementation it's hard to say if there is any Trojan.

Explanation: Based on the provided code, there does not seem to be any hardware Trojan in the design. A Trojan would usually involve some sort of unauthorized modification to the original design that could leak information or cause the system to malfunction. However, without seeing the full design of the one_round and final_round modules, it's hard to be completely certain.
