Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This is the main module where the AES encryption is performed. The main operations are key expansion and performing the rounds of encryption. There doesn't seem to be any obvious point of vulnerability here, but the operations' dependence on the 'clk' signal could potentially be exploited if an attacker manages to manipulate it.
- expand_key_128 module: This module expands the key used in the encryption. The key is divided into four parts, and each part is XORed with the 'rcon' value. This could also be a potential point of vulnerability if the 'rcon' value can be manipulated or predicted by an attacker. But there is no clear evidence of a Trojan here.
  
Explanation: Based on the code provided, there doesn't appear to be a hardware Trojan present. However, it's important to note that Trojans can be incredibly subtle and difficult to detect, so this doesn't definitively mean the system is secure. It is always recommended to use well-tested libraries and modules for cryptographic operations, and ensure that the hardware these operations are being performed on is secure.
