Hardware Trojan: Yes

Security Analysis:
1. aes_128 module:
   - The aes_128 module implements the AES encryption algorithm.
   - It takes a clock signal, state (plaintext), and key as inputs, and produces the encrypted output as the "out" signal.
   - The state and key are used as inputs to various sub-modules to perform the encryption process.
   - There doesn't seem to be any security vulnerabilities or suspicious behavior in this module.

2. expand_key_128 module:
   - The expand_key_128 module is responsible for generating the round keys used in the AES encryption process.
   - It takes the clock signal, input key, and a round constant (rcon) as inputs, and produces two sets of round keys as outputs.
   - The module
