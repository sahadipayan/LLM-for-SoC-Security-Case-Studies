Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes inputs of clk, state, and key, and produces outputs of out, rk1, rk2, rk3, rk4, rk5, rk6, rk7, and rk8. The module consists of multiple rounds (one_round) and a final round (final_round) of AES encryption. The key expansion is done using the expand_key_128 module. There is no apparent security vulnerability in this module.

- expand_key_128 module: This module performs the key expansion for AES-128. It takes inputs of clk, in, and rcon, and produces outputs of out_1 and out_2. The key expansion involves XOR operations and S-box substitutions. The module does not have any security vulnerabilities.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design.
