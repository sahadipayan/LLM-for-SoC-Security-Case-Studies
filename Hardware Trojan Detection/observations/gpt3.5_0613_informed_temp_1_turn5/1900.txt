Hardware Trojan: No

Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 cipher algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, and key as inputs, and produces an encrypted output. The implementation appears to be correct and does not raise any security concerns.

- expand_key_128 module: This module expands the 128-bit key into 11 round keys using the AES key expansion algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, input key, and round constant as inputs, and produces two round keys as outputs. The implementation appears to be correct and does not raise any security concerns.

- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, input state, and round key as inputs, and produces an updated state as output. The implementation appears to be correct and does not raise any security concerns.

- final_round module: This module performs the final round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, input state, and round key as inputs, and produces the final encrypted state as output. The implementation appears to be correct and does not raise any security concerns.

- module1 module: This module implements some additional functionality related to dynamic power and counter. It does not directly contribute to the AES cipher implementation and does not raise any security concerns.

Explanation: There is no hardware trojan identified in the given AES design.
