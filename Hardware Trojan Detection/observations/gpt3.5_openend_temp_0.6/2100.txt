Hardware Trojan: No

Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes the clock, reset signal, state, key as inputs, and provides the encrypted output. It uses the expand_key_128, one_round, and final_round modules to perform the encryption. From a security perspective, the AES algorithm is considered secure if implemented correctly.
- expand_key_128 module: This module expands the initial key into multiple round keys using the AES key expansion algorithm. It takes the clock, input key, and rcon as inputs, and provides two outputs out_1 and out_2. The module performs the key expansion correctly based on the AES algorithm, ensuring the security of the encryption.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of AES encryption. It takes the clock, state_in, key, and provides the state_out as output. The module correctly implements the AES encryption algorithm and does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.
- final_round module: This module performs the final round of AES encryption. It takes the clock, state_in, key_in, and provides the state_out as output. Similar to the one_round module, it implements the AES encryption algorithm correctly without introducing any security vulnerabilities.
- module2 module: This module has a register SECRETKey which stores a 128-bit key. It also has a counter COUNTER which increments on each clock cycle. The w2 signal is derived from the least significant bit of the SECRETKey. There are multiple inverters (INV1_out to INV11_out) which are connected to w2. From a security perspective, this module does not seem to have any direct impact on the security of the AES encryption algorithm.
- module1 module: This module has a counter Counter which increments on each clock cycle. The w1 signal is set to 1 when the Counter reaches the maximum value. This can be used as a signal to trigger certain operations in the design. From a security perspective, this module does not seem to have any direct impact on the security of the AES encryption algorithm.

Explanation:
Based on the analysis of the design, there is no hardware Trojan found. All the modules in the design seem to implement the AES encryption algorithm correctly without introducing any security vulnerabilities. The design appears to be secure from a hardware perspective.
