Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 block cipher algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, and key as inputs, and produces an encrypted output. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform key expansion and encryption rounds.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys. It takes in a clock signal, input key, and a round constant as inputs, and produces two round keys as outputs. The module uses a shift register and XOR operations to generate the round keys.

- one_round module: This module performs one round of AES encryption. It takes in a clock signal, state, round key, and a previous round key as inputs, and produces the updated state for the next round. The module uses various operations such as SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey to perform the encryption.

- final_round module: This module performs the final round of AES encryption. It takes in a clock signal, state, final round key, and produces the final encrypted output. The module performs SubBytes, ShiftRows, and AddRoundKey operations.

Hardware Trojan: No, there is no hardware trojan in the design.
