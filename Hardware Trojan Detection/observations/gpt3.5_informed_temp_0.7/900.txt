Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes inputs of state and key, and produces the output ciphertext. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform different operations like key expansion and rounds of encryption. The security of this module depends on the correctness and robustness of the AES algorithm implementation.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the original key into a set of round keys used in the encryption process. It takes the original key as input and produces two sets of round keys as outputs. The security of this module depends on the correctness of the key expansion algorithm and
