Module aes_128:
- This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm.
- It takes inputs clk, rst, state, and key, and produces the output out.
- The inputs state and key are XORed together and stored in s0 and k0 registers, respectively, on the positive edge of the clk signal.
- The AES key is expanded using the expand_key_128 module, and then one_round module is executed 9 times to perform 9 rounds of AES encryption.
- In the final round, the output is obtained using the final_round module.
- The module also includes an additional module called module1, which generates an output signal w1.

Module expand_key_128:
- This module is responsible for expanding the AES key.
- It takes inputs clk, in, and rcon, and produces two outputs out_1 and out_2.
- The input key is split into four 32-bit parts, k0, k1, k2, and k3.
- These four parts are used to generate four round keys using XOR operations and a shift register.
- The generated round keys are stored in out_1 and out_2 registers.

Module one_round:
- This module performs one round of AES encryption.
- It takes inputs clk, state_in, and key, and produces the output state_out.
- The input state_in and key are split into four 32-bit parts, s0, s1, s2, s3, and k0, k1, k2, k3, respectively.
- The module performs table lookups and XOR operations to obtain intermediate values, and then combines them to produce the output state_out.

Module final_round:
- This module performs the final round of AES encryption.
- It takes inputs clk, state_in, and key_in, and produces the output state_out.
- The input state_in and key_in are split into four 32-bit parts, s0, s1, s2, s3, and k0, k1, k2, k3, respectively.
- The module uses the S4 module to perform table lookups and XOR operations to obtain intermediate values, and then combines them to produce the output state_out.

Module S4:
- This module is a lookup table for the AES encryption algorithm.
- It takes inputs clk and in, and produces the output out.
- The input in is used to perform table lookups and produce the output out.

Module module1:
- This module generates a 4-bit counter that increments on the positive edge of the clk signal.
- The counter is reset to 0 when the rst signal is low.
- The output w2 is the most significant bit of the counter.
