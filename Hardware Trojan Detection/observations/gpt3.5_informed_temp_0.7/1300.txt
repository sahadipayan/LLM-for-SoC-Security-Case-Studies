Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes the clock signal, state, and key as inputs and produces the encrypted output and round keys as outputs. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform different functions such as key expansion and encryption rounds. From a security perspective, the AES algorithm is considered secure and has been extensively analyzed for vulnerabilities.
- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the initial key into a set of round keys used in the encryption process. It takes the clock signal, input key, and round constant as inputs and produces two sets of round keys as outputs. The module uses a combination of logical operations and shift registers to generate the round keys. From a security perspective, the key expansion process is considered secure and does not introduce any vulnerabilities.
- module1 module: This module acts as a trigger for the hardware trojan. It takes the reset signal and state as inputs and produces a signal called w1 as output. The w1 signal is set to 1 when the state matches a specific predefined value. From a security perspective, this module does not introduce any vulnerabilities.
- module2 module: This module controls the activation of the hardware trojan based on the w1 signal and certain conditions involving the round keys and state. The trojan is activated when the w1 signal is high and the specific conditions are met. From a security perspective, this module contains the hardware trojan and can compromise the security of the AES encryption if triggered.
Explanation: The hardware trojan in this design is implemented in the module2 module. It operates by activating when the w1 signal is high and specific conditions involving the round keys and state are met. The trojan manipulates the output of the AES encryption by flipping certain bits, potentially compromising the security of the encryption.
