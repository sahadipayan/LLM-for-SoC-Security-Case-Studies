Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis:
- module1: This module generates a signal w1 that is high for two clock cycles when the state input is all 1's (128'hFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF). Otherwise, w1 is low. There is no security vulnerability or suspicious behavior in this module.
- module2: This module generates a signal w3 based on the SECRETKey and COUNTER inputs. It also includes multiple inverters (INV1_out to INV11_out) that are not connected to any sensitive signals. There is no security vulnerability or suspicious behavior in this module.

Explanation: There is no hardware trojan present in the design. All modules in the design perform their intended functions without any malicious behavior.
