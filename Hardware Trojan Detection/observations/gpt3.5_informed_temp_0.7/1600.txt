Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis:
- module top: This module is the top-level module that instantiates the AES, module1, and module2 modules. It connects the inputs and outputs of these modules.
- module aes_128: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It has sub-modules for key expansion, one round encryption, and final round encryption. The inputs are the clock, state, and key, and the outputs are the encrypted output and a signal o. The security of the AES algorithm depends on the strength of the key and the encryption algorithm itself.
- module expand_key_128: This module is responsible for expanding the 128-bit key into a set of round keys used in the AES algorithm. It takes the clock, input key, and a round constant as inputs and generates the round keys as outputs. The security of this module is important to ensure that the key expansion is performed correctly.
- module module1: This module has a state machine that detects a specific input sequence and sets a signal w1 to high for two clock cycles. It also has a register (Detected) that indicates when the input sequence has been detected. The security of this module depends on the correctness of the input sequence detection and the prevention of false positives.
- module module2: This module has a shift register (SHIFTReg) that is loaded with the key when a specific condition is met. It also has a counter (Baud8GeneratorACC) that increments with each clock cycle. Based on certain conditions involving the counter and the shift register, it generates an output signal o. The security of this module depends on the integrity of the key loading and the correct generation of the output signal.
Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan detected in the design. Each module performs its intended function without any malicious behavior.
