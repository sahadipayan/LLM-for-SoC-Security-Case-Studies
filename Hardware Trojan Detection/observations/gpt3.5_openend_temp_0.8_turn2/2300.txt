Hardware Trojan: No

Security Analysis:
1. expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the initial key into multiple round keys. It performs operations such as XOR, bit shifting, and table lookups to generate the round keys. From a security perspective, this module is critical as any weaknesses or vulnerabilities in the key expansion process could compromise the security of the AES algorithm. However, upon analysis, there are no apparent security issues or vulnerabilities in this module.

2. one_round module: This module represents one round of the AES encryption process. It performs table lookups, XOR operations, and substitution operations to process the input state and generate the output state. Similar to the expand_key_128 module, the security of this module is crucial for the overall security of the AES algorithm. However, after analysis, no security issues or vulnerabilities are observed in this module.

3. final_round module: This module represents the final round of the AES encryption process. It performs table lookups, XOR operations, and substitution operations similar to the one_round module. Again, the security of this module is critical, but no security issues or vulnerabilities are observed.

Explanation: After analyzing the design block by block, there are no apparent hardware Trojans present in the design. The modules responsible for the core AES encryption operations perform their intended functions without any malicious or suspicious behavior. Therefore, the design is considered secure and free from hardware Trojans.
