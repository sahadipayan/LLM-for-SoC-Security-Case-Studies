Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis:
1. aes_128 module: This module implements the AES encryption algorithm. It takes the clock signal, state (plaintext), key, and outputs the encrypted output. From a security perspective, the design of this module is crucial. It is necessary to ensure that the AES algorithm is implemented correctly and securely to prevent any vulnerabilities or potential attacks.

2. expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the initial key into a round key schedule used in AES encryption. It takes the clock signal, input key, and outputs two round keys. The security analysis of this module would involve verifying the correctness of the key expansion algorithm and ensuring that there are no vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the implementation.

3. one_round module: This module performs one round of AES encryption. It takes the clock signal, an input state, a round key, and outputs the state after one round. The security analysis of this
