Hardware Trojan: Yes

Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, and key as inputs, and produces the encrypted output as the output. The security of this module depends on the strength of the AES algorithm itself, which is considered secure against known attacks.

- expand_key_128 module: This module expands the input key into a set of round keys used in the AES encryption process. It takes in a clock signal, input key, and a round constant as inputs, and produces two sets of round keys as outputs. The security of this module depends on the security of the key expansion algorithm, which is also considered secure against known attacks.

- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES encryption
