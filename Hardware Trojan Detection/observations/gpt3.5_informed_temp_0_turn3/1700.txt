Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, and key as inputs, and produces the encrypted output as the output. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform different operations such as key expansion and encryption rounds.
- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys. It takes in the clock signal, input key, and a round constant as inputs, and produces two round keys as outputs. The module uses a shift register and XOR operations to generate the round keys.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, state, round key, and a round constant as inputs, and produces the updated state as the output. The module uses various operations such as substitution, permutation, and XOR to update the state.
- final_round module: This module performs the final round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, state, round key, and a round constant as inputs, and produces the encrypted output as the output. The module uses similar operations as the one_round module to update the state.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm and its sub-modules perform the necessary operations to encrypt the input data. The design does not contain any malicious or unauthorized functionality.
