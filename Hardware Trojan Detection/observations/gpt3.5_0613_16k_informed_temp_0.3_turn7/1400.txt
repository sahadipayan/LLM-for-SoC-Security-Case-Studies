Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 block cipher algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, key, and outputs the encrypted output and round keys. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform key expansion and encryption rounds.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys. It takes in a clock signal, input key, and round constant. It outputs two round keys. The module uses a combination of XOR and shift operations to generate the round keys.

- one_round module: This module performs one round of encryption. It takes in a clock signal, input state, round key, and outputs the updated state. The module uses a combination of substitution, permutation, and XOR operations to update the state.

- final_round module: This module performs the final round of encryption. It takes in a clock signal, input state, round key, and outputs the encrypted output. The module uses a combination of substitution, permutation, and XOR operations to update the state and generate the final encrypted output.

Hardware Trojan: No

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design implements the AES-128 block cipher algorithm and performs key expansion and encryption rounds in a secure manner.
