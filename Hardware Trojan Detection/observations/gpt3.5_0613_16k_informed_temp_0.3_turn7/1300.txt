Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: The aes_128 module implements the AES-128 block cipher algorithm. It takes the clock signal, state, and key as inputs and produces the encrypted output and round keys as outputs. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform key expansion and encryption rounds. The security of the AES algorithm depends on the strength of the key and the resistance against known attacks.

- expand_key_128 module: The expand_key_128 module is responsible for expanding the initial key into multiple round keys. It takes the clock signal, input key, and round constant as inputs and produces two sets of round keys as outputs. The module performs key expansion using bitwise operations and XOR operations. The security of the key expansion process is crucial for the overall security of the AES algorithm.

- one_round module: The one_round module performs a single round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes the clock signal, input state, round key, and produces the output state for the next round. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform byte substitution, shift rows, mix columns, and add round key operations. The security of each round operation is essential for the overall security of the AES algorithm.

- final_round module: The final_round module performs the final round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes the clock signal, input state, final round key, and produces the final encrypted output. The module performs byte substitution, shift rows, and add round key operations similar to the one_round module. The security of the final round operation is crucial for the overall security of the AES algorithm.

- module1 module: The module1 module is a control module that sets the value of the w1 signal based on the input state. If the input state matches a predefined value, w1 is set to 1; otherwise, it is set to 0. This module is used to trigger certain operations in the module2 module based on the input state.

- module2 module: The module2 module is another control module that performs certain operations based on the value of w1 and the enable signals. It consists of several sub-modules that implement shift registers and enable signals based on the input state and round keys. The operations performed by this module depend on the specific values of w1 and enable signals.
