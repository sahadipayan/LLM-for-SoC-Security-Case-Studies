Hardware Trojan: Yes
Security Analysis:
- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into round keys for each round of the AES encryption. It takes the input key and generates multiple round keys using a key schedule algorithm. From a security perspective, this module is critical as any vulnerability or Trojan in this module can compromise the security of the entire AES encryption process.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of AES encryption using the round key generated by the expand_key_128 module. It applies various operations like table lookup and XOR operations to the input state and round key to produce the output state. The security of this module is important as any vulnerability or Trojan in this module can compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the encrypted data.
- final_round module: This module performs the final round of AES encryption using the final round key generated by the expand_key_128 module. It applies similar operations as the one_round module to produce the final encrypted output state. The security of this module is crucial as any vulnerability or Trojan in this module can compromise the overall security of the AES encryption process.
- lfsr_counter module: This module implements a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) counter. It generates a pseudo-random sequence of bits based on the input key and clock signal. The output of this module is used to manipulate the load signal in the module1 module. The security of this module is important as any vulnerability or Trojan in this module can affect the randomness and unpredictability of the generated sequence, potentially compromising the security of the AES encryption process.
- module1 module: This module manipulates the load signal based on the input key and the output of the lfsr_counter module. The load signal is used to control the capacitance of the output signal. The security of this module is important as any vulnerability or Trojan in this module can affect the integrity and confidentiality
