Hardware Trojan: Yes

Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, and key as inputs and produces the encrypted output. The security of this module depends on the security of the AES algorithm itself. If the AES algorithm is secure, then this module is also secure.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into round keys for each round of the AES algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, input key, and a round constant as inputs and produces two sets of round keys as outputs. The security of this module depends on the security of the key expansion algorithm. If the key expansion algorithm is secure, then this
