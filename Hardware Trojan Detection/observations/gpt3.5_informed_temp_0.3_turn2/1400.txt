Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes inputs of state and key, and produces the encrypted output. The module also includes sub-modules for key expansion and one round of encryption. From a security perspective, the AES-128 algorithm is considered secure and resistant to various cryptographic attacks.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys used in the AES encryption process. It takes the input key and generates multiple round keys using a key expansion algorithm. The module includes sub-modules for key expansion and key mixing. From a security perspective, the key expansion algorithm is designed to ensure the security of the generated round keys.

- one_round module: This module performs one round of AES encryption. It takes the input state and round key, and produces the output state for the next round. The module includes sub-modules for various AES operations such as SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey. From a security perspective, each operation in the one_round module is designed to provide security and prevent cryptographic attacks.

- final_round module: This module performs the final round of AES encryption. It takes the input state and final round key, and produces the encrypted output. The module includes sub-modules for SubBytes, ShiftRows, and AddRoundKey operations specific to the final round. From a security perspective, the final round operations ensure the security and integrity of the encrypted output.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan identified in the design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm and its associated modules in a standard and secure manner.
