Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, key, and outputs the encrypted output. The module consists of several sub-modules for key expansion, one round encryption, and final round encryption. From a security perspective, the AES algorithm is considered secure and widely used in various applications.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys used in the AES encryption process. It takes in a clock signal, input key, and rcon (round constant) and outputs two round keys. The module performs key expansion using XOR and shift operations. From a security perspective, the key expansion process is an essential part of the AES algorithm and does not introduce any known vulnerabilities.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm and its key expansion process, which are widely used and considered secure.
