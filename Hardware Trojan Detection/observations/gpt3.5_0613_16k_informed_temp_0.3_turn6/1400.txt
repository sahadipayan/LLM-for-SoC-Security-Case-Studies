Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes a 128-bit state and key as inputs and produces a 128-bit output. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform key expansion and encryption rounds.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the 128-bit input key into multiple round keys. It uses the Rijndael key schedule to generate the round keys. The module takes the input key and a round constant as inputs and produces two sets of round keys as outputs.

- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes the state and a round key as inputs and produces the updated state as output. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform byte substitution, shift rows, mix columns, and add round key operations.

- final_round module: This module performs the final round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes the state and the last round key as inputs and produces the final encrypted output.

Hardware Trojan: No

Explanation: There is no hardware trojan in the design. The design implements the standard AES-128 encryption algorithm without any malicious modifications or additional functionality.
