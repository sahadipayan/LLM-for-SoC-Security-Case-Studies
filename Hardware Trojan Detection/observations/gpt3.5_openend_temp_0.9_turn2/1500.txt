Security Analysis:

1. aes_128 module:
   - The aes_128 module implements the main AES encryption algorithm.
   - It takes the input state and key, and produces the output state and round keys.
   - The round keys are derived using the expand_key_128 module, which generates the necessary round keys for each round of AES.
   - The module performs XOR operations between the state and key using the always @ (posedge clk) block, which is triggered on every positive clock edge.
   - The generated round keys are assigned to individual wires, rk1 to rk8.
   - There is no security vulnerability or suspicious behavior identified in this module.

2. expand_key_128 module:
   - The expand_key_128 module generates the round keys for AES encryption.
   - It takes the input key and generates 10 round keys using a key expansion algorithm.
   - The key expansion algorithm is implemented using a series of XOR operations and bit manipulations.
   - The key expansion process is
