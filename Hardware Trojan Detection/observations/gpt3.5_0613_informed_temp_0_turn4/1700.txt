Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, key, and outputs the encrypted output. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform key expansion and encryption rounds.
- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys. It takes in a clock signal, input key, and a round constant. It outputs two round keys. The module uses a shift register and XOR operations to generate the round keys.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of AES encryption. It takes in a clock signal, state, round key, and outputs the updated state for the next round. The module uses various operations such as substitution, permutation, and XOR to update the state.
- final_round module: This module performs the final round of AES encryption. It takes in a clock signal, state, round key, and outputs the encrypted output. The module uses similar operations as the one_round module but without the key mixing step.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm and consists of modules that perform key expansion and encryption rounds. The modules operate based on the AES algorithm specifications and do not contain any malicious functionality.
