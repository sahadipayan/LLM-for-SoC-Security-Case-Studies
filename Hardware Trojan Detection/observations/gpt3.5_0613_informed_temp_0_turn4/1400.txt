Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: The aes_128 module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, key, and outputs the encrypted output (out) and round keys (rk1-rk8). From a security perspective, the module appears to be implementing the AES algorithm correctly without any obvious vulnerabilities.

- expand_key_128 module: The expand_key_128 module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys. It takes in a clock signal, input key (in), and rcon (round constant), and outputs two round keys (out_1 and out_2). The module performs key expansion using the AES key schedule algorithm. From a security perspective, the module appears to be implementing the key expansion correctly without any obvious vulnerabilities.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm and key expansion correctly without any suspicious or malicious behavior.
