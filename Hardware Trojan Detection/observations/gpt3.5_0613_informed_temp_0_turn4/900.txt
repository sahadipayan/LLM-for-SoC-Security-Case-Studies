Hardware Trojan: Yes
Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. From a security perspective, it is important to ensure that the implementation follows the AES standard and does not introduce any vulnerabilities or weaknesses. Without further analysis, it is difficult to determine if there are any security issues in this module.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into round keys for each round of the AES algorithm. Similar to the aes_128 module, it is important to ensure that the key expansion follows the AES standard and does not introduce any vulnerabilities or weaknesses.

- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES algorithm. Again, it is important to ensure that the implementation follows the AES standard and does not introduce any vulnerabilities
