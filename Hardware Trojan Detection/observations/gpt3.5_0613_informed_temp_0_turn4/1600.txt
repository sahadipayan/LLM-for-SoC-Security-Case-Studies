Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, and key as inputs, and produces the encrypted output as out. The module uses various sub-modules to perform the different rounds of the AES algorithm.
- expand_key_128 module: This module expands the input key into multiple round keys using the AES key schedule. It takes in the clock signal, input key, and a round constant as inputs, and produces two sets of round keys as outputs. The module uses a shift register and XOR operations to generate the round keys.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, input state, and round key as inputs, and produces the output state for the next round. The module uses table lookups and XOR operations to perform the AES operations.
- final_round module: This module performs the final round of the AES algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, input state, and round key as inputs, and produces the final encrypted output state. The module uses table lookups and XOR operations similar to the one_round module.
- module1 module: This module is not directly related to the AES algorithm. It takes in the reset signal, clock signal, and state as inputs, and produces a signal w1 as output. The module also has internal registers and logic to detect a specific sequence of states and set the Detected signal accordingly.
- module2 module: This module is also not directly related to the AES algorithm. It takes in the key, clock signal, reset signal, and w1 signal as inputs, and produces an output signal o. The module uses a baud rate generator and a shift register to generate a specific sequence of signals based on the key and clock signal. The output o is activated based on specific conditions involving the generated signals.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan detected in the design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm and includes additional modules for specific functionality. The modules operate as intended and do not exhibit any suspicious or malicious behavior.
