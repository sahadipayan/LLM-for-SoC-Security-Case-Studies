Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes the clock signal, state, key as inputs and produces the encrypted output (out) and round keys (rk1-rk8). The module does not have any security vulnerabilities or trojans.
- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the original key into multiple round keys. It takes the clock signal, input key, and rcon as inputs and produces two sets of round keys (out_1 and out_2). The module does not have any security vulnerabilities or trojans.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes the clock signal, input state, key, and produces the output state after one round of encryption. The module does not have any security vulnerabilities or trojans.
- final_round module: This module performs the final round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes the clock signal, input state, key,
