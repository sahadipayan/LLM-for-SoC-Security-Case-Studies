Hardware Trojan: No

Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, state, key, and produces the encrypted output (out) and round keys (rk1 to rk8). From a security perspective, the AES algorithm is considered secure and widely used in various applications.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the original key into multiple round keys used in the AES algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, input key (in), and rcon (round constant). It produces two outputs, out_1 and out_2, which are the expanded round keys. There doesn't seem to be any security concerns with this module.

Explanation: 
Based on the given design, there doesn't appear to be any hardware Trojan. A hardware Trojan is a malicious modification or insertion of circuitry in a design that can perform unauthorized or harmful activities. However, without further information or inspection of the design, it is not possible to conclusively determine the absence of a hardware Trojan.
