Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, key, and outputs the encrypted output. The state and key are 128-bit inputs. The module consists of various submodules that perform key expansion and encryption rounds.
- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys. It takes in a clock signal, input key, and a round constant. It outputs two round keys. The module consists of combinatorial logic and a shift register.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of AES encryption. It takes in a clock signal, state, round key, and outputs the updated state for the next round. The module consists of various submodules that perform substitution, permutation, and key mixing operations.
- final_round module: This module performs the final round of AES encryption. It takes in a clock signal, state, final round key, and outputs the encrypted output. The module consists of similar submodules as the one_round module.

Explanation: There is no hardware trojan in the design. The design implements the AES encryption algorithm and does not contain any malicious functionality.
