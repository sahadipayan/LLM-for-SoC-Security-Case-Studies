Hardware Trojan: No

Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes a clock signal, state, key, and outputs the encrypted output (out) and several round keys (rk1 to rk8). The module contains several sub-modules that perform different parts of the encryption process, such as key expansion and rounds.

- expand_key_128 module: This module performs key expansion for AES-128. It takes a clock signal, input key (in), and rcon value, and outputs two sets of keys (out_1 and out_2). The module uses a shift operation and XOR operations to generate the expanded keys.

- one_round module: This module performs one round of AES-128 encryption. It takes a clock signal, state, key, and outputs the updated state for the next round. The module performs XOR operations and substitution operations on the state and key.

- final_round module: This module performs the final round of AES-128 encryption. It takes a clock signal, state, key, and outputs the encrypted output. The module performs XOR operations and substitution operations on the state and key.

Explanation: There is no hardware trojan present in the design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm in a straightforward manner without any malicious or covert functionality.
