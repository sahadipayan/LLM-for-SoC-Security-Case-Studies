Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, reset signal, state and key inputs, and produces an output called "out". The module consists of various sub-modules such as expand_key_128, one_round, and final_round. The security of this module depends on the correctness and robustness of the AES algorithm implementation.
- expand_key_128 module: This module expands the 128-bit key into 11 round keys. It takes in a clock signal, input key, and a round constant (rcon). The module consists of combinatorial logic to perform key expansion. The security of this module depends on the correctness of the key expansion algorithm and the resistance against key leakage.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of AES encryption. It takes in a clock signal, state input, key, and produces a state output. The module consists of combinatorial logic and table lookups to perform the AES round operations. The security of this module depends on the correctness and robustness of the AES round operations.
- final_round module: This module performs the final round of AES encryption. It takes in a clock signal, state input, key input, and produces a state output. The module consists of combinatorial logic and table lookups similar to the one_round module. The security of this module depends on the correctness and robustness of the final round operations.

Explanation: No hardware Trojan is present in the design. The design implements the AES encryption algorithm using different modules, and the security of the design depends on the correctness and robustness of the AES algorithm implementation.
