Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: The aes_128 module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes a clock signal, state, key, and produces the encrypted output (out) and round keys (rk1-rk8). The module uses various sub-modules to perform key expansion and encryption rounds.
- expand_key_128 module: The expand_key_128 module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys. It takes a clock signal, input key (in), and round constant (rcon), and produces two output round keys (out_1 and out_2). The module uses various sub-modules to perform key expansion.
- one_round module: The one_round module performs one round of AES encryption. It takes a clock signal, state, round key (k0b), and produces the output state (s1). The module uses various sub-modules to perform the encryption operations.
- final_round module: The final_round module performs the final round of AES encryption. It takes a clock signal, state, round key (k9b), and produces the encrypted output (out). The module uses various sub-modules to perform the encryption operations.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm using standard modules and sub-modules. Each module performs its intended function without any malicious behavior.
