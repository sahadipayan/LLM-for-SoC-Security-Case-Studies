Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes inputs of clk, rst, state, and key, and produces the output out. The module consists of sub-modules such as expand_key_128, one_round, and final_round, which perform different operations of the AES algorithm. From a security perspective, the AES algorithm is considered secure and widely used in various applications.
- expand_key_128 module: This module expands the input key into multiple round keys using the AES key schedule. It takes inputs of clk, in, and rcon, and produces outputs out_1 and out_2. The module performs key expansion operations and does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES algorithm. It takes inputs of clk, state_in, and key, and produces the output state_out. The module consists of sub-modules such as table_lookup, which performs table lookups based on the input state and key. From a security perspective, the AES algorithm is considered secure and this module does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.
- final_round module: This module performs the final round of the AES algorithm. It takes inputs of clk, state_in, and key_in, and produces the output state_out. The module consists of sub-modules such as S4, which performs S-box substitutions based on the input state. From a security perspective, the AES algorithm is considered secure and this module does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.
Explanation: There is no hardware trojan in the design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm, which is widely used and considered secure. Each module performs its intended operations without introducing any security vulnerabilities.
