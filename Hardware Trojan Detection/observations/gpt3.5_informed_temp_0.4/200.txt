Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, and key as inputs, and produces the encrypted output (out). The state and key are XORed together and stored in registers s0 and k0 respectively. The key is then expanded using the expand_key_128 module. One round of AES encryption is performed using the one_round module, and the final round is performed using the final_round module. The encrypted output is stored in the state_out register.
- expand_key_128 module: This module takes in a clock signal, an input key, and a round constant (rcon) as inputs. It expands the input key into 10 round keys using the AES key expansion algorithm. The expanded keys are stored in registers out_1 and out_2.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of AES encryption. It takes in a clock signal, an input state, and a round key as inputs. The input state is divided into four 32-bit words, which are then passed through a table lookup module to perform the SubBytes operation. The resulting values are XORed with the round key and stored in registers z0, z1, z2, and z3. The output state is formed by concatenating these four registers.
- final_round module: This module performs the final round of AES encryption. It takes in a clock signal, an input state, and a round key as inputs. The input state is divided into four 32-bit words, which are then passed through a table lookup module to perform the SubBytes operation. The resulting values are XORed with the round key and stored in registers z0, z1, z2, and
