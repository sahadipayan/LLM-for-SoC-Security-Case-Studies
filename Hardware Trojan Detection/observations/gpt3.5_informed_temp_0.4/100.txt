Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, reset signal, state (plaintext) and key as inputs, and outputs the encrypted output. From a security perspective, the AES algorithm is considered to be secure against known attacks.
- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the key used in the AES algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, input key, and a round constant as inputs, and outputs two keys. The key expansion process is a critical part of the AES algorithm, and any vulnerabilities in this module could potentially compromise the security of the encryption. However, without further analysis, it is not possible to determine if there are any security vulnerabilities in this module.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, input state, key, and outputs the updated state for the next round. Similar to the aes_128 module, the security of this module depends on the security of the AES algorithm.
- final_round module: This module performs the final round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, input state, key, and outputs the final encrypted output. Again, the security of this module depends on the security of the AES algorithm.
- lfsr_counter module: This module implements a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) counter. It takes in the reset signal, clock signal, and outputs a 20-bit counter. This module does not directly contribute to the security of the AES algorithm.

Explanation: There is no hardware trojan in the design. The design implements the AES encryption algorithm, which is a widely used and studied cryptographic algorithm. However, without further analysis, it is not possible to determine if there are
