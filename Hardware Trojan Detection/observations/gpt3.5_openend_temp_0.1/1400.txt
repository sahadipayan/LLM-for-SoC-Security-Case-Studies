Hardware Trojan: No

Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes a clock signal, state, key as inputs and produces the encrypted output (out) and round keys (rk1-rk8) as outputs. The module consists of sub-modules for key expansion (expand_key_128), one round encryption (one_round), and final round encryption (final_round). From a security perspective, the AES algorithm is considered secure and widely used in various applications.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys. It takes a clock signal, input key (in), round constant (rcon) as inputs and produces two round keys (out_1 and out_2) as outputs. The module performs key expansion using the AES key schedule algorithm. It XORs the round constant with the first byte of the input key and performs a cyclic shift operation. The resulting value is then XORed with the previous round key to generate the next round key. This process is repeated multiple times to generate all the round keys. From a security perspective, the key expansion process is an essential part of the AES algorithm and does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm and key expansion process according to the AES standard. The modules are designed to perform their intended functions without any malicious behavior.
