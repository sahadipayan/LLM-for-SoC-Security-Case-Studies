Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes a clock signal, state and key inputs, and produces the encrypted output. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform key expansion and encryption rounds.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys. It takes a clock signal, input key, and round constant as inputs, and produces two round keys as outputs. The module uses a shift register and XOR operations to generate the round keys.

- one_round module: This module performs one round of AES encryption. It takes a clock signal, state, round key, and produces the intermediate state for the next round. The module uses various AES operations such as SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey.

- final_round module: This module performs the final round of AES encryption. It takes a clock signal, state, round key, and produces the encrypted output. The module performs SubBytes, ShiftRows, and AddRoundKey operations.

Hardware Trojan: No hardware trojan is present in the design.

Explanation: There is no hardware trojan present in the given design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm without any malicious modifications or additional functionality.
