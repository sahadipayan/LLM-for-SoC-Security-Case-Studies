Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, and key as inputs, and produces the encrypted output as the output. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform key expansion and encryption rounds. From a security perspective, the AES algorithm is considered secure against known attacks when implemented correctly.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into round keys used in the AES encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, input key, and a round constant (rcon) as inputs, and produces two round keys as outputs. The module performs key expansion using bitwise operations and XOR operations. From a security perspective, the key expansion process is crucial for the security of the AES algorithm, and any vulnerabilities in this module could potentially compromise the security of the encryption.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan identified in the design. The design consists of standard modules implementing the AES encryption algorithm. However, it is important to note that the absence of a hardware Trojan cannot be guaranteed without a thorough analysis of the entire design and its manufacturing process.
