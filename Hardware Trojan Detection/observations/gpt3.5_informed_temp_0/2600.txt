Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes a clock signal, reset signal, state and key inputs, and produces an encrypted output. The module consists of several sub-modules such as expand_key_128, one_round, and final_round, which perform different operations in the AES algorithm.
- expand_key_128 module: This module expands the input key into multiple round keys using the AES key schedule. It takes a clock signal, input key, and round constant as inputs, and produces two sets of round keys as outputs. The module uses a shift register and XOR operations to generate the round keys.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes a clock signal, state input, key input, and produces a modified state output. The module uses table lookups and XOR operations to modify the state based on the key.
- final_round module: This module performs the final round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes a clock signal, state input, key input, and produces the final encrypted output. The module uses table lookups and XOR operations similar to the one_round module.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design implements the AES encryption algorithm and its sub-modules perform the necessary operations for encryption.
