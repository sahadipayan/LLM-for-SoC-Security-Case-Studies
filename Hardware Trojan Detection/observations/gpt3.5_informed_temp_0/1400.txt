Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes inputs of clk, state, and key, and produces outputs of out, rk1, rk2, rk3, rk4, rk5, rk6, rk7, and rk8. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform different rounds of the AES algorithm. From a security perspective, the AES algorithm is considered secure and has been extensively analyzed for vulnerabilities. However, the security of the implementation also depends on the security of the key used.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys used in the AES algorithm. It takes inputs of clk, in, and rcon, and produces outputs of out_1 and out_2. The module performs key expansion using a series of XOR operations and shift operations. From a security perspective, the key expansion process is an important part of the AES algorithm and should be implemented correctly to ensure the security of the encryption.

Explanation: There is no hardware trojan in the design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm and key expansion process, which are standard and widely used cryptographic algorithms. The design does not contain any suspicious or malicious components that could be considered as a hardware trojan.
