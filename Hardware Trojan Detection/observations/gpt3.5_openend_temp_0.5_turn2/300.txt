Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES encryption algorithm. It takes the clock signal, state, key as inputs and produces the encrypted output (out) and 8 round keys (rk1-rk8). There is no security vulnerability or trojan in this module.
- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into 10 round keys. It uses a key schedule to generate the round keys. There is no security vulnerability or trojan in this module.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of AES encryption. It takes the clock signal, input state, round key as inputs and produces the output state after one round. There is no security vulnerability or trojan in this module.
- final_round module: This module performs the final round of AES encryption. It takes the clock signal, input state, round key as inputs and produces the final encrypted output state. There is no security vulnerability or trojan in this module.
- module1 module: This module implements a shift register and updates the shift register based on the enable signals from the aes_128 module. There is no security vulnerability or trojan in this module.

Explanation: There is no hardware trojan in the design. All the modules in the design perform their intended functions without any malicious behavior.
