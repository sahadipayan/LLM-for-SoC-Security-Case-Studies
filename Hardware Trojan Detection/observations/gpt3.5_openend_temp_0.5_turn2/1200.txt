Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: The aes_128 module implements the AES encryption algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, state and key inputs, and produces the encrypted output in the out signal. The module consists of sub-modules for key expansion, one round encryption, and final round encryption. From a security perspective, the AES algorithm is considered secure and widely used in various applications.
- expand_key_128 module: The expand_key_128 module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys for use in the AES encryption algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, input key, and a round constant input. The module performs key expansion using XOR operations and bit manipulation. From a security perspective, the key expansion process is an essential part of the AES algorithm and does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.
- lfsr_counter module: The lfsr_counter module implements a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) counter. It takes in the reset signal, clock signal, data input, and produces a 20-bit LFSR output. The LFSR counter is used to generate a pseudo-random sequence for the load signal in the module2 module. From a security perspective, the LFSR counter does not introduce any security vulnerabilities as it is a commonly used technique for generating pseudo-random numbers.
- module1 module: The module1 module is responsible for generating a control signal w1 based on the output of the aes_128 module and a counter. The w1 signal is used in the module2 module. From a security perspective, the module1 module does not introduce any security vulnerabilities as it only generates a control signal based on the output of the AES encryption.
- module2 module: The module2 module takes in the reset signal, clock signal, w1 control signal, key input, data input, and produces a 64-bit load signal. The load signal is generated based on the key input and a counter generated by the lfsr_counter module. From a security perspective, the module2 module does not introduce any security vulnerabilities as it only performs XOR operations between the key input and the counter to generate the load signal.
Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design consists of modules that implement the AES encryption algorithm and related functionality. Each module performs its intended function and does not introduce any security vulnerabilities.
