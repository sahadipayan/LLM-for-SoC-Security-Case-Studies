Hardware Trojan: Yes

Security Analysis: 

1. aes_128 module: From the security standpoint, it implements AES-128 cryptographic algorithm, which provides high security and is regarded as one of the safest cryptographic algorithms available currently. However, there is an extra circuit module1 connected to s3, which indicates a potential danger.

2. expand_key_128 module: This module expands the encryption key for every round. As far as the security of this module is concerned, no abnormality is observed unless the source of the key itself is not secure.

3. one_round module: This module performs encryption operations per round. It seems to be securely designed as it implements the standard AES operations. 

4. final_round module: This module executes the final round of the AES encryption. It also appears to be designed securely, strictly following AES specifications.

5. module1: This is where the potential hardware trojan resides. It is an additional module, not typically found in standard AES designs, and appears to be acting as a counter. This could be a potential "time bomb" hardware trojan, that is set off after a certain count is reached.

Explanation: The Trojan is found in the extra circuit module1, which serves as a counter, increasing itself by 1 when the 122nd bit of the s3 signal from the third round of AES encryption is 1. The output of this module (seemingly a 4-bit counter) is then xored with the least significant bit of the AES output. This could lead to a small fraction of the outputs being altered in a seemingly random manner. It might potentially cause cryptography errors or information leakage, and hence the presence of the hardware trojan can lead to severe security implications. However, as the triggering of the Trojan mechanism is quite specific and requires the specified bit to be 1, the impact might only manifest under certain conditions or over a prolonged period of usage.
