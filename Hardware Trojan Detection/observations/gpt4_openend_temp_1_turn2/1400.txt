Hardware Trojan: No

Security Analysis: 
1. `aes_128 module` - This is the main module that represents the AES architecture with 128-bit keys. The inputs are a state and key, the output is an encrypted piece of data. Another eight sets of outputs are expanded keys used in AES round functions. The module implements the Expanded Key and AES round functions. From a security perspective, the use of expanded keys provides enhanced security by deriving separate keys for each round of the AES encryption process.
   
2. `expand_key_128 module` - This module takes a key and a constant (rcon) as input and generates two outputs (out_1, out_2). The module performs the key expansion necessary for the AES algorithm. This module helps to improve data security by expanding the key size to improve randomness and reduce the probability of successful brute force attacks.

Explanation: Since the provided code snippets seem to be part of an AES encryption implementation, there is no apparent hardware trojan to be identified. It functions typically to how AES encryption works - it uses an input key and uses it to create new expanded keys per round to make the process more secure. As per the implementation given, there are no signs of a hardware trojan, but in a real-world scenario, it's recommended to have an expert review the entire design. They should perform static and dynamic vulnerability scans to ensure there are no vulnerabilities that could be used to insert a hardware Trojan. Hardware Trojans are typically malicious modifications to the digital design, and such modifications are not observed here. Features that could suggest a Trojan might be unexpected or unnecessary changes in the hardware design, connections to or from the outside world that bypass security measures, etc. None of these features are present in the provided code.
