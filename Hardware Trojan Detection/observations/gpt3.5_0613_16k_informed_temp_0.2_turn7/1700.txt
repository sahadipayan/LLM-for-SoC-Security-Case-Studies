Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 block cipher. It takes in a clock signal, state (input plaintext), key, and outputs the encrypted output. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform key expansion and encryption rounds.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys. It takes in a clock signal, input key, and rcon (round constant). It outputs two sets of round keys. The module performs XOR operations and bit shifting to generate the round keys.

- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, input state, round key, and outputs the intermediate state. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform byte substitution, row shifting, column mixing, and round key addition.

- final_round module: This module performs the final round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, input state, round key, and outputs the encrypted output. The module performs byte substitution, row shifting, and round key addition.
