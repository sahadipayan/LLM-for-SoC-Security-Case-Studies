Hardware Trojan: Yes
Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: The aes_128 module is responsible for performing the AES encryption algorithm. From a security perspective, the module appears to be secure as it does not contain any known vulnerabilities or backdoors.
- expand_key_128 module: The expand_key_128 module is responsible for expanding the initial key into a series of round keys for use in the AES encryption algorithm. From a security perspective, the module appears to be secure as it only performs simple bitwise operations on the key and does not introduce any vulnerabilities or backdoors.
- one_round module: The one_round module is responsible for performing one round of the AES encryption algorithm. From a security perspective, the module appears to be secure as it follows the standard AES encryption process without introducing any vulnerabilities or
