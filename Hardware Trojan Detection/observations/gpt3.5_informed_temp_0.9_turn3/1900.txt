Hardware Trojan: No

Security Analysis:
- aes_128: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, and key as inputs, and outputs the encrypted data. From a security perspective, the AES-128 algorithm is considered secure against known attacks.
- expand_key_128: This module expands the key used in the AES-128 algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, the original key, and a round constant as inputs, and outputs two expanded key values. It performs key expansion using the Rijndael key schedule. From a security perspective, the key expansion process is an essential part of the AES-128 algorithm and is considered secure.
- one_round: This module performs one round of the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, the input state, the round key, and outputs the state after one round. From a security perspective, each round of the AES-128 algorithm is designed to provide diffusion and confusion properties, making it difficult to analyze and break.
- final_round: This module performs the final round of the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, the input state, the final round key, and outputs the final encrypted state. From a security perspective, the final round of the AES-128 algorithm is designed to ensure the ciphertext is indistinguishable from random data.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm following standard security practices.
