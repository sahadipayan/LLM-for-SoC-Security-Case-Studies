Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: 
  - It takes in the clock signal, state, and key as inputs, and outputs the encrypted data. It performs the AES-128 encryption algorithm.
  - The state and key are XORed together to generate the initial state of the AES algorithm.
  - The key undergoes key expansion to generate subkeys for each round of encryption.
  - It consists of multiple rounds, where each round performs operations such as substitution, permutation, and XORing with the subkey.
  - The final round performs additional operations before outputting the encrypted data.
  - From a security perspective, the strength of the AES encryption depends on the key length and the specific operations performed in each round.

- expand_key_128 module: 
  - It takes in the clock signal and the 128-bit input key and generates the expanded keys used in the AES encryption algorithm.
  - The input key is processed through a series of transformations and XOR operations with round constants to generate the expanded keys.
  - The expanded keys are used in each round of the AES algorithm.
  - From a security perspective, the strength of the expanded keys depends on the randomness and complexity of the key expansion process.

- one_round module: 
  - It performs one round of the AES encryption algorithm.
  - It takes in the clock signal, the state input from the previous round, the round key, and outputs the updated state for the next round.
  - The state input undergoes substitution, permutation, and XOR operations with the round key.
  - From a security perspective, the strength of one round depends on the specific operations performed and the randomness of the round key.

- final_round module: 
  - It performs the final round of the AES encryption algorithm.
  - It takes in the clock signal, the state input from the previous round, the round key, and outputs the final encrypted data.
  - The state input undergoes a different set of operations compared to the previous rounds, including an additional XOR with the round key.
  - From a security perspective, the strength of the final round depends on the specific operations performed and the randomness of the round key.

- module1 module:
  - It takes in the reset signal and the state input and outputs a signal w1.
  - It assigns w1 as 1 when the reset signal is not active and the state matches a specific value (128'h00112233_44556677_8899aabb_ccddeeff).
  - From a security perspective, this module does not have any direct impact on the security of the AES encryption algorithm.

- module2 module:
  - It takes in the reset signal, clock signal, w1, key, and outputs a 64-bit load signal.
  - It contains an lfsr_counter module that generates a 20-bit shift register counter.
  - When the reset signal is active, the load signal is set to 0. When w1 is active, the load signal is generated by XORing specific bits of the key with the counter.
  - From a security perspective, this module does not have any direct impact on the security of the AES encryption algorithm.

Hardware Trojan: No
