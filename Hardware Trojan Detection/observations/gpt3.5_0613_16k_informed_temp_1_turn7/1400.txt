Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 block cipher algorithm. It takes input plaintext and key, and produces the encrypted output. The security of AES-128 depends on the key used and the resistance against various cryptographic attacks.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into the round keys used in each round of the AES algorithm. It takes the input key and produces multiple round keys. The security of this module is crucial as it determines the strength of the key schedule.

- one_round module: This module represents one round of the AES algorithm. It takes the state and round key as input, performs the required operations, and produces the output for the next round. The security of this module is important to ensure the correctness and integrity of the encryption process.

- final_round module: This module represents the final round of the AES algorithm. It takes the state and the last round key as input, performs the final operations, and produces the final encrypted output. The security of this module is critical as any vulnerability or weakness in this round can compromise the security of the whole encryption process.
