Security Analysis:
-AES-128 Block Cipher:
The AES-128 block cipher is a widely used encryption algorithm known for its security. It operates on 128-bit data blocks and uses a 128-bit key. The algorithm consists of several rounds, with each round performing specific operations such as substitution, permutation, and XORing with the round key. Overall, from a security perspective, the AES-128 block cipher provides a strong level of encryption.
-Expand Key 128:
The "expand_key_128" module is responsible for expanding the original 128-bit key into a set of round keys that are used during the encryption process. It uses a round constant to generate the key schedule. From a security perspective, the key expansion process is critical in ensuring the strength of the encryption. 
-One Round:
The "one_round" module performs one round of the AES-128 encryption process. It consists of various operations, including table lookups, XORing with round keys, and substitution. Each round applies these operations to the data from the previous round. From a security perspective, each round introduces additional diffusion and confusion, making the encryption more secure.
-Final Round:
The "final_round" module is the last round of the AES-128 encryption process. It performs similar operations to the "one_round" module but without the additional XORing with the round key. This final round ensures the final transformation of the data before outputting the encrypted result. From a security perspective, the final round contributes to the overall strength of the encryption.
-Module1:
The "module1" module appears to be a custom module in the design. It takes the "rst" signal and the "state" input as inputs and generates the "w1" output. The module has several states that are transitioned based on the "rst" and "state" inputs. The purpose and security analysis of this module are unclear from the provided information.
-Module2:
The "module2" module is another custom module in the design. It takes the "clk", "rst", "key", and "w1" inputs and generates an output, INV11_out. The module has several internal signals and performs logical operations on the input signals. The purpose and security analysis of this module are also unclear from the provided information.

Hardware Trojan: No hardware trojan has been identified in the design based on the provided information.

Explanation: 
Based on the given design and information, no hardware trojan has been identified in the design. However, further analysis and examination of the custom modules (module1 and module2) may be required to ensure the absence of any hardware trojans.
