Hardware Trojan: No

Security Analysis:
1. Module aes_128:
   - It takes the state and key as inputs and produces the encrypted output as well as round keys rk1 to rk8.
   - There is no significant security concern in this module as it performs the standard AES encryption algorithm.

2. Module expand_key_128:
   - It takes the original key as input and generates round keys rk1 to rk10.
   - There is no significant security concern in this module as it performs the key expansion process according to the AES algorithm.

3. Module one_round:
   - It performs one round of AES encryption using the state and key.
   - There is no significant security concern in this module as it follows the standard AES encryption process.

4. Module final_round:
   - It performs the final round of AES encryption using the state and key.
   - There is no significant security concern in this module as it follows the standard AES encryption process.

5. Module module1:
   - This module implements a shift register operation based on the enable signals derived from the AES encryption process.
   - There is no significant security concern in this module as it performs a simple shift operation and does not handle sensitive data.

Explanation:
There is no hardware Trojan identified in the design. All the modules perform their intended AES encryption functions without any malicious behavior.
