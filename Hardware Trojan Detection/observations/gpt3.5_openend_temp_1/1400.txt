Hardware Trojan: No

Security Analysis:

- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. The security of AES depends on the key length, and in this design, a 128-bit key is used. The implementation appears to be correct and follows the standard AES algorithm without any obvious vulnerabilities.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the original key into multiple round keys using the AES key schedule. The implementation appears to be secure and follows the standard key expansion algorithm without any obvious vulnerabilities.

The design does not have any obvious hardware Trojan. The modules follow the standard AES algorithm and key expansion process, without any additional suspicious or malicious functionality.
