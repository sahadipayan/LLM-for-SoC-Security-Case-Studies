Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, and key as inputs, and produces the encrypted output as the output. The module uses various sub-modules to perform key expansion and encryption rounds.
- expand_key_128 module: This module expands the original key into multiple round keys using the key expansion algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, input key, and a round constant as inputs, and produces two round keys as outputs.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of AES encryption. It takes in the clock signal, input state, and round key as inputs, and produces the updated state as the output. The module uses a table lookup sub-module to perform the necessary operations.
- final_round module: This module performs the final round of AES encryption. It takes in the clock signal, input state, input key, and produces the final encrypted state as the output. The module uses a table lookup sub-module to perform the necessary operations.
- module1: This module generates a signal "w1" based on the state input. If the state is equal to the maximum value, "w1" is set to 1 for two clock cycles. Otherwise, it is set to 0.
- module2: This module manipulates the SECRETKey based on the "w1" signal and a counter. It also performs multiple logical inversions on the "w3" signal.

Explanation: There is no hardware trojan in the design. The design implements the AES encryption algorithm and its key expansion algorithm. The modules work together to perform the encryption process.
