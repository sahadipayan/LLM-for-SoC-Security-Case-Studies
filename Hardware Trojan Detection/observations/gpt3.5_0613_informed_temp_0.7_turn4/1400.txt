Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: The aes_128 module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes the clock signal, state, key, and produces the encrypted output (out) as well as intermediate round keys (rk1-rk8). From a security perspective, the AES algorithm is considered secure and widely used in cryptographic applications. However, the module itself does not implement any specific security measures or countermeasures against potential attacks. 

- expand_key_128 module: The expand_key_128 module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys. It takes the clock signal, input key (in), rcon value, and produces two sets of output keys (out_1, out_2). This module performs the key expansion process required by the AES algorithm. From a security perspective, the key expansion process is crucial for the overall security of the encryption algorithm. However, the module itself does not implement any specific security measures or countermeasures against potential attacks.

Explanation: 
There is no hardware Trojan detected in the design. The design consists of two modules, aes_128 and expand_key_128, which implement the AES-128 encryption algorithm and key expansion process, respectively. Both modules do not exhibit any suspicious or malicious behavior that can be associated with a hardware Trojan.
