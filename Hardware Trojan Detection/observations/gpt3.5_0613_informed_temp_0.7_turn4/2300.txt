Hardware Trojan: Yes

Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, reset signal, state and key inputs, and outputs the encrypted data. The security analysis of this module would involve examining the implementation of the AES algorithm itself and ensuring that it is resistant to known cryptographic attacks. 

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the key used in the AES algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, input key, and a round constant. The module outputs two versions of the expanded key. The security analysis of this module would involve ensuring that the key expansion algorithm is secure and resistant to attacks such as key recovery or key leakage. 

- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, state input, key input, and outputs the updated state. The security analysis of this module would involve examining the implementation of the round function and ensuring that it is resistant to attacks such as differential or linear cryptanalysis. 

- final_round module: This module performs the final round of the AES algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, state input, key input, and outputs the final encrypted data. The security analysis of this module would involve examining the implementation of the final round function and ensuring that it does not introduce any vulnerabilities or weaken the security of the encryption algorithm. 

Explanation:
Based on the provided design, there is no explicit mention of any hardware trojan. However, without a detailed examination of the design and each module, it is not possible to definitively determine the presence of a hardware trojan. Each module would need to be analyzed for any suspicious or unexpected behavior that could indicate the presence of a trojan.
