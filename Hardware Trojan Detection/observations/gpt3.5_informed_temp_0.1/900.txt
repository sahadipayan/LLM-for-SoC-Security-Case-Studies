Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, and key as inputs, and produces the encrypted output as the output. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform different operations in each round of the AES algorithm.
- expand_key_128 module: This module expands the input key into a set of round keys using the AES key schedule. It takes in the clock signal, input key, and a round constant as inputs, and produces two sets of round keys as outputs.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES algorithm. It takes
