Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, reset signal, state (plaintext), and key as inputs, and produces the encrypted output (out). The module consists of several sub-modules that perform different operations in each round of the AES algorithm. From a security perspective, the AES algorithm is considered secure and resistant to various attacks.
- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into round keys used in each round of the AES algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, input key, and a round constant (rcon) as inputs, and produces two round keys (out_1 and out_2) as outputs. The module uses a combination of bitwise operations and table lookups to generate the round keys. From a security perspective, the key expansion process is an essential part of the AES algorithm and is designed to ensure the security of the encryption process.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, input state, round key, and produces the output state after one round. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform different operations, including table lookups and XOR operations. From a security perspective, each round of the AES algorithm is designed to provide confusion and diffusion properties, making it resistant to various attacks.
- final_round module: This module performs the final round of the AES algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, input state, and round key as inputs, and produces the final encrypted output state. The module uses the same operations as the one_round module but without the key expansion process. From a security perspective, the final round ensures the completion of the encryption process and provides additional security properties.
