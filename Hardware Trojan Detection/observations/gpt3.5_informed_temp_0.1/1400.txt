Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes inputs of clk, state, and key, and produces outputs of out, rk1, rk2, rk3, rk4, rk5, rk6, rk7, and rk8. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform different rounds of encryption. From a security perspective, the AES algorithm is considered secure and has been extensively analyzed for vulnerabilities. However, the security of the implementation also depends on the security of the key and the protection against side-channel attacks.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys. It takes inputs of clk, in, and rcon, and produces outputs of out_1 and out_2. The module performs key expansion using the AES key schedule algorithm. From a security perspective, the key expansion process is crucial for the security of the AES algorithm. If the key expansion is weak or vulnerable to attacks, it can compromise the security of the encryption.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm and key expansion using standard techniques. However, it is important to note that the security of the implementation also depends on the protection against side-channel attacks and the security of the key used.
