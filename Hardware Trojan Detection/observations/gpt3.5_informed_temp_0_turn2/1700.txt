Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 

1. aes_128 module:
- There doesn't appear to be any immediate security concerns within this module. It takes clock input (clk) along with state and key inputs, and produces the output (out) using a combination of various modules.
- The module uses a synchronous always block triggered by the positive edge of the clock signal to assign values to registers (s0 and k0) at each clock cycle.

2. expand_key_128 module:
- This module takes the input (in) and generates the expanded key for AES algorithm using the Rijndael key schedule.
- The input (in) is divided into four 32-bit sections (k0, k1, k2, k3), and each section is processed in combination with the "rcon" (round constant) input to generate intermediate values (v0, v1, v2, v3).
- These intermediate values are further processed through the cryptographic operations to generate the expanded key.
- No security concerns arise from this module.

3. one_round module:
- This module performs one round of the AES encryption algorithm.
- It takes the state and round key inputs, and produces a new state output by involving various predefined operations.
- Each round shifts rows, applies the substitution box (S-box), performs mix columns, and adds the round key.
- No additional security concerns arise from this module.

4. final_round module:
- This module executes the final round of the AES encryption algorithm.
- It carries out similar operations as the previous rounds but without performing the mix columns operation.

Explanation:
Based on the analysis of the provided AES design, there does not appear to be any hardware trojans in the design. The various modules perform their respective cryptographic operations within the accepted boundaries of the AES algorithm specifications.
