Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- module top: This module is the top-level module that instantiates the AES module, module1, and module2. It connects the inputs and outputs of these modules.
- module aes_128: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes the clock, state, and key as inputs and produces the encrypted output. It consists of sub-modules for key expansion, one round, and final round.
- module expand_key_128: This module is responsible for expanding the 128-bit key into round keys. It takes the clock, input key, and round constant as inputs and produces two sets of round keys as outputs.
- module one_round: This module performs one round of AES encryption. It takes the clock, input state, round key, and
