Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes a clock signal, state, key, and outputs the encrypted output. The module consists of several sub-modules for key expansion, one round encryption, and final round encryption. From a security perspective, the module appears to be implementing the AES algorithm correctly without any obvious vulnerabilities.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys used in the AES encryption algorithm. It takes a clock signal, input key, and an 8-bit round constant. The module performs key expansion using XOR and shift operations. From a security perspective, the module appears to be correctly implementing the key expansion process without any obvious vulnerabilities.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm and its key expansion correctly.
