Hardware Trojan: Yes

Security Analysis:
1. Module top: This top-level design module might raise a security concern because it evokes the "module1" (suspected Trojan) and "module2". 
2. Module aes_128: The aes_128 block is a standard method for performing the AES-128 encryption. There doesn't seem to be a hardware trojan here, but a function of this could be compromised by an outside module.
3. Module expand_key_128: The expand_key_128 function seems safe on its own. However, its output could potentially be compromised externally.
4. Module lfsr_counter: The functionality of this block seems to be standard for an LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register). However, w1 signal affects the data processing. The w1 signal is from module1, which is suspicious.
5. Module module2: The Trojan resides here. It is utilized with values passed from the LFSR, which operation is manipulated by 'w1'. There is a considerable data block that is exclusive-or XORed with key bytes, which technically can compromise the AES encryption.
6. Module module1: In this module, several suspicious operation signals are defined. Any changes in the state input trigger a hard-coded state. This hard-coded state is a potential security threat. This module seems to control when the Trojan is activated, using the signal 'w1'.

Explanation:
The hardware Trojan in this design connects two independent modules: 'module1' and 'module2'. The triggering event for the Trojan is in 'module1'. Here, a particular series of 'state' inputs results in the production of 'w1' signal. The 'w1' signal is then used as part of the trigger mechanism for the 'lfsr_counter' in 'module2', where it induces the counter to run, producing a Trojan effect by affecting the standard AES encryption process. The compromised data, XORed with key bytes, can potentially leak essential data, compromising the entire AES encryption.
