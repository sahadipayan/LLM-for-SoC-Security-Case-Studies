Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes the clock, state, key, and produces encrypted output in the out signal. It uses multiple internal wires and registers to perform the encryption rounds. The security of this module depends on the strength of the AES algorithm.
- expand_key_128 module: This module expands the original key into multiple round keys which are used in the AES encryption rounds. It takes the clock, input key, and rcon value as inputs, and produces two output keys. The module performs some bitwise operations to generate the round keys. From a security perspective, if the key expansion algorithm is implemented correctly, it should not introduce any vulnerabilities.
- one_round module: This module represents one round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes the clock, input state, key, and produces the modified state after one round. The module performs table lookups and bitwise operations to transform the state. Again, the security of this module depends on the strength of the AES algorithm.
- final_round module: This module represents the final round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes the clock, input state, key, and produces the final encrypted state. Similar to the one_round module, the security of this module depends on the strength of the AES algorithm.
- module1 module: This module controls the state transitions of the design based on the input state. It uses a set of registers to track the current state and generates a w1 signal when a specific condition is met. From a security perspective, this module does not introduce any vulnerabilities unless the state conditions and transitions are intentionally manipulated.
- module2 module: This module generates a load signal based on the key and a counter value. The load signal is used to control the loading of data. From a security perspective, this module does not introduce any vulnerabilities unless the inputs (key and counter) are manipulated to produce unintended behavior.
Explanation: No hardware Trojan is found in the design. The design consists of different modules implementing the AES encryption algorithm. The security of the design depends on the strength of the AES algorithm itself.
