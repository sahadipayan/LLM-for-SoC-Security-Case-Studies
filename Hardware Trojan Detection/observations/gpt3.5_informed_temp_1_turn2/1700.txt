Hardware Trojan: Yes
Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module:
    - The aes_128 module is the main module responsible for performing the AES-128 encryption.
    - It takes the clock signal, state (plaintext), key, and outputs the encrypted output.
    - It contains a reg s0 and k0 to store the state and key values.
    - The always block triggered on the positive edge of the clock updates s0 and k0 based on the state and key values.
    - The aes_128 module uses the "expand_key_128" module and "one_round" module to perform key expansion and one round of AES encryption respectively.
    - In the final_round, the "final_round" module is used to generate the final encrypted output.

- expand_key_128 module:
    - The expand_key_128 module is responsible for key expansion in the AES algorithm.
    - It takes the clock signal, input key, rcon (round constant), and outputs two keys.
    - It contains reg and wire variables to store intermediate key values.
    - The module performs key expansion using XOR operations and shifts on the input key.
    - The output keys are generated based on the input key and round constant values.

- one_round module:
    - The one_round module performs one round of AES encryption.
    - It takes the clock signal, state, intermediate key, and outputs the updated state.
    - It contains reg and wire variables to store intermediate state values.
    - The module performs substitution and permutation operations on the state and intermediate key to generate the updated state.

- final_round module:
    - The final_round module performs the final round of AES encryption.
    - It takes the clock signal, state, and final round key, and outputs the encrypted output.
    - It contains reg and wire variables to store intermediate state values.
    - The module performs substitution and permutation operations on the state and final round key to generate the encrypted output.

Explanation:
Yes, there is a hardware trojan in the design. The trojan operates by leaking the AES key through leakage current. It uses a shift register and inverters to leak the key through the least significant bit of the shift register when it is '0'. This trojan operates in the "Leak via Current 1" mode.
