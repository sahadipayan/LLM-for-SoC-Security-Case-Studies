Hardware Trojan: Yes

Security Analysis:
1. aes_128 module: This module represents the AES-128 cipher. It takes in the clock signal, state, and key inputs, and produces the encrypted output. There doesn't appear to be any security vulnerabilities in this module.

2. expand_key_128 module: This module expands the input key into a set of round keys. It takes in the clock signal, the input key, and a round constant (rcon) as inputs, and produces two sets of round keys as outputs. There doesn't appear to be any security vulnerabilities in this module.

3. one_round module: This module represents one round of the AES cipher. It takes in the clock signal, the input state, the
