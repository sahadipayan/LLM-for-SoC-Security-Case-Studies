Hardware Trojan: Yes
Security Analysis: 
1. module top(clk, rst, state, key, out)
   - No specific security concerns identified.

2. module aes_128(clk, state, key, out)
   - No specific security concerns identified.

3. module expand_key_128(clk, in, out_1, out_2, rcon)
   - No specific security concerns identified.

4. module one_round (clk, state_in, key, state_out)
   - No specific security concerns identified.

5. module final_round (clk, state_in, key_in, state_out)
   - No specific security concerns identified.

6. module module1(clk, rst, state)
   - No specific security concerns identified.

Explanation:
Although no specific security concerns or Trojans have been identified in the given AES design, it is important to note that the absence of visible Trojans does not guarantee the absence of hidden or undetectable Trojans. A thorough analysis of the design, including reverse engineering and side-channel analysis, would be necessary to provide a definitive answer regarding the presence or absence of hardware Trojans.
