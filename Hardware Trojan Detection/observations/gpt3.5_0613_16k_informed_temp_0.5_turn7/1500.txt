Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: The AES encryption algorithm is implemented in this module. It takes in the clock signal, state, and key as inputs, and produces the encrypted output (out) and round keys (rk1-rk8) as outputs. The module consists of various sub-modules that perform key expansion and encryption rounds.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the initial key into round keys. It takes in the clock signal, input key, and rcon (round constant) as inputs, and produces two sets of round keys (out_1 and out_2) as outputs. The module uses a shift register and XOR operations to generate the round keys.

- one_round module: This module performs one round of AES encryption. It takes in the clock signal, state input, key, and produces the updated state output. The module uses table lookups and XOR operations to update the state.

- final_round module: This module performs the final round of AES encryption. It takes in the clock signal, state input, key input, and produces the final encrypted output. The module uses table lookups and XOR operations to update the state.

- module1 module: This module generates a control signal (w1) based on the clock signal and a counter. The control signal is used to enable/disable the hardware trojan.

- module2 module: This module implements the hardware trojan. It takes in various inputs including the trojan trigger (w1), state, and round keys (rk1-rk8). The module consists of multiple registers and enables the trojan based on the trigger signal and specific conditions involving the state and round keys.

Hardware Trojan: Yes
Explanation: The hardware trojan is implemented in the module2 module. The trojan trigger is the control signal w1, which is generated by the module1 module. When the trigger is active (w1 = 1), the trojan is enabled. The trojan operates by XORing specific bits of the state and round keys, and based on the result, it enables specific registers (SHReg1-SHReg8) to shift their values. The trojan is activated when specific conditions involving the state and round keys are met, and it modifies the values stored in the registers. The exact purpose and functionality of the trojan are not specified in the given design.
