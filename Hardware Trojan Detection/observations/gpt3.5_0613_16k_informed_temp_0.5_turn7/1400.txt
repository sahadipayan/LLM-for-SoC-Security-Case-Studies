Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 block cipher algorithm. It takes a 128-bit state and key as inputs and produces a 128-bit output. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform key expansion and encryption rounds.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into a set of round keys. It takes the input key and generates 10 round keys using the AES key expansion algorithm.

- one_round module: This module performs a single round of AES encryption. It takes the current state and round key as inputs and produces the next state as output. This module is instantiated 9 times to perform 9 rounds of encryption.

- final_round module: This module performs the final round of AES encryption. It takes the current state and the last round key as inputs and produces the final encrypted output.

Hardware Trojan: No

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design implements the AES-128 block cipher algorithm without any malicious functionality or hidden behavior.
