Hardware Torjan: Yes
Security Analysis: 
While this design appears to be a standard implementation of an AES-128 crypto accelerator, there are additional modules named "module1" and "module2" that don't belong to a typical AES-128 module and raise some security concerns. 

1. aes_128 module: The core of the AES encryption algorithm, where operations of the AES-128 encryption system take place. It seems to be safe, as all operations are standard for AES-128.

2. expand_key_128 module: Its job to expand the encryption key, there doesn't seem to be anything amiss here.

3. one_round module: This module seems to be implementing one round of AES-128 processing as per the AES standard.

4. final_round module:  The final round of AES processing, nothing unordinary seems to be happening here.

5. module1: A state machine operates on the input 'state' when it matches specific hardcoded values in a specific sequence. It sets the value w1 high on completion of these states. The hardcoded values could constitute a backdoor password, which is a security threat.

6. module2: The SECRETKey is updated either with the input 'key' or the right-shifted value of SECRETKey, based on the value of w1. A counter runs independently in parallel. It also produces a series of inverted values based on a w2. This is potential behavior of a hardware Trojan as it modifies the key of the AES algorithm, which is a critical piece of the encryption puzzle.

Explanation: 
The Trojan operates in two stages using "module1" and "module2". The check for specific values in "module1" is effectively a hardcoded password, which could be considered a backdoor. If the correct sequence of 'state' values are given as input, the output w1 will be high and triggers the "module2". 

"module2" makes use of a counter that runs independently. If the output w1 gets high (from "module1"), the SECRETKey updates with the key as input. Otherwise, the SECRETKey is right-shifted by one bit each time the most significant bit of the counter goes high. This modification to the key is suspicious and is likely to manipulate the encryption process.

Therefore the Trojan manipulates the encryption key depending on the input signal 'state', this manipulated key can then be used by an attacker to compromise the AES encryption.
