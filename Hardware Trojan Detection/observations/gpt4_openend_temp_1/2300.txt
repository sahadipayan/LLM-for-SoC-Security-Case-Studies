Hardware Trojan: Yes
Security Analysis: 

1. aes_128: This is the top-level module of the AES secure system. It's hard to find any security issues here since it's the main module setting up communication between all other modules.

2. expand_key_128: This module expands the 128-bit key. Security-wise, no issues detected here.

3. one_round: This module performs a single AES encryption round. There doesn't seem to be any Trojan here.

4. final_round: Final encryption round of AES. No Trojan detected.

5. module1: Concern arises over the module1 that takes two sections of the cipher (s2[89] and s5[121]) and passes them into a new output (w1). This is unusual for typical AES method, and it raises the possibility of a hardware Trojan.

Explanation: The suspected hardware Trojan is detected within the module1. This block takes two specific bits of the AES state, s2[89] and s5[121], passing them through an AND gate and outputs w1 which is then XORed with the LSB of the output from the final_round. 

In terms of security, this might have significant implications. It looks like this Trojan is a data leakage Trojan. The state of these two specific points in the encryption process is leaked through the output bit of the AES cipher. This could provide crucial information to an attacker to help recover the key. This can expose sensitive information and undermine the security of the entire system. 

Thus, the detected Trojan is a leakage and can lead to serious breaches of data if not handled with urgent rectification.
