Hardware Trojan: Yes

Security Analysis: 

1. aes_128 module: This module has inputs of clock, reset, state, and key along with output. If these inputs and outputs are not properly secured, it can lead to potential security issues. Moreover, the 'module1' operation1(clk, rst, w1) is suspicious as it does not contribute to AES functionalities.

2. expand_key_128 module: This module expands the input key by generating multiple intermediate keys. These keys need to be stored securely, as any leakage of these can severely compromise the AES encryption system.

3. one_round and final_round module: These modules are executing AES rounds and handling encrypted data. It is crucial that they are implemented properly and data during these rounds should be secured, otherwise, it can compromise the whole encryption system.

4. module1: This module increments a counter upon each clock cycle and outputs a signal 'w2' corresponding to the most significant bit of the counter. This module seems to be irrelevant to the AES process and thus it raises a concern regarding a possible hardware trojan.

Explanation: The hardware trojan in this design is the module1. It does not contribute to the functionality of AES-128 encryption, and thus, its existence is suspicious. Its function is to increment a counter with every positive edge of the clock. Once the counter reaches the maximum value (1111 in binary, 15 in decimals), it overflows, resets itself to zero and the process repeats. 

The output of module1 (w2 signal) is propagated to the least significant bit of output from the aes_128 module, thereby altering the encryption output. This can create a noticeable pattern in the output encrypted data, which could potentially be exploited by attackers to deduct certain characteristics of the encryption key or process. 

For instance, a change in output every 16th cycle (considering that the counter is 4-bit wide) can be observed. With enough samples, an attacker might be able to make educated guesses about the encryption process, thereby compromising the security of the entire system.
