Hardware Trojan: Yes
Security Analysis: 
- As for the AES module, it seems secure. It comprises key expansion and different rounds of AES computations correctly implementing the operations of SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey. 
- The expand_key_128 module logically produces AES round keys from the initial cipher key. Its implementation seems safe. 
- The one_round and final_round modules perform encryption operations effectively providing confidentiality, ensuring the security of data during transmission.
- Then there is a module named "module1". Note that this module varies significantly from the original design given as it calculates certain "enable" signals based on XORing various combinations of state and round key bits, triggering various shift registers. 

Explanation: 
- The Trojan is apparently built into the "module1". It manipulates round key and state bits under certain conditions. 
- The shift registers are manipulated using controls "enable1" to "enable8", which are a function of specific bits from the round keys and state. 
- The Trojan-enabled shift registers actions could constitute a side-channel, as under certain conditions (when "enable" is true) the round key or the state information might be leaked out of these shift registers, thereby compromising the key or plaintext/ciphertext.
- Depending upon which bits 'state' and 'rk' are selected and the order in which they are selected the trojan can be very harmful.
- Such a hardware Trojan could be used for a variety of malicious purposes including bypassing security, unauthorized data access, and even denial-of-service. Therefore, the Trojan in the design is a serious security concern and should be addressed immediately.
