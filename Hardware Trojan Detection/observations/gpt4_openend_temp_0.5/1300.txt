Security Analysis: 

1. Module Top: This is the top-level module which integrates all the other modules. It doesn't contain any specific logic and hence doesn't pose any security threat.

2. AES_128: This is the main AES encryption module. It follows the standard AES encryption operation and doesn't seem to have any security flaws.

3. Expand_key_128: This module is responsible for key expansion in AES. The key expansion process seems to be standard and doesn't have any security vulnerabilities.

4. Module1: This module checks if the state is equal to a specific value and if the reset signal is high. If the state is equal to the specified value, it sets the output signal 'w1' high. This could potentially be used to trigger a trojan if the state ever equals the specified value.

5. Module2: This module contains shift registers and logic to enable the shift registers based on the state and round keys. This could potentially be used to leak information about the state and round keys.

Hardware Trojan: Yes

Explanation: The hardware trojan in this design is potentially in the module1 and module2. In module1, if the state is equal to a specific value, it sets the output signal 'w1' high. This signal 'w1' is then used in module2 to control the shift registers. The shift registers are enabled based on the state and round keys. This could potentially be used to leak information about the state and round keys. If an attacker can control the state to be equal to the specified value in module1, they can trigger the trojan and start leaking information.
