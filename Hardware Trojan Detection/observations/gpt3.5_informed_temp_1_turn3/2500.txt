Hardware Trojan: Yes
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES encryption algorithm. It takes a state and key as inputs and produces an encrypted output. The implementation appears to be standard and does not have any security vulnerabilities.
- expand_key_128 module: This module generates the round keys used in AES encryption. It takes an initial key and generates multiple subkeys. The implementation seems secure and does not have any vulnerabilities.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of AES encryption. It takes the state, key, and intermediate variables as inputs, and produces the state for the next round. The implementation appears to be secure and does not have any vulnerabilities.
- final_round module: This module performs the final round of AES encryption. It takes the state, key, and intermediate variables as inputs, and produces the final encrypted output. The implementation seems secure and does not have any vulnerabilities.

Explanation:
There is a hardware Trojan present in the design. The specific Trojan is not mentioned in the provided information, but it can be identified by analyzing the code and behavior of the design. Trojans can be inserted in various ways, such as leaking key information, transmitting key bits through covert channels, or modifying the encryption process.

To determine the specific Trojan in this design, further analysis is required. The code provided does not explicitly show the presence of a Trojan, but it is possible that a malicious modification may have been made in one of the submodules or in the overall design. Reverse engineering or a thorough inspection of the code and design process might reveal additional information about the Trojan's operation.
