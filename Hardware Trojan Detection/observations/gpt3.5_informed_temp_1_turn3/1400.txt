Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module is responsible for implementing the AES-128 encryption algorithm. From a security perspective, the module appears to be properly implemented and does not exhibit any obvious vulnerabilities or weaknesses.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for generating the round keys used in the AES encryption process. The key expansion process appears to be correct and follows the standard AES specifications. There are no obvious security issues with this module.

Explanation: There is no hardware trojan in the design. The AES design block has been analyzed module by module and appears to be implemented following the standard AES encryption algorithm. There are no signs of malicious behavior or intentional vulnerabilities in the design.
