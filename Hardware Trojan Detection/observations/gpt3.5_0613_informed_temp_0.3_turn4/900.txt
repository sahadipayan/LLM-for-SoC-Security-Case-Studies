Hardware Trojan: Yes
Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. From a security perspective, it is important to ensure that the implementation follows the AES standard and does not introduce any vulnerabilities or weaknesses that can be exploited.
- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into a set of round keys. It uses a combination of XOR operations and table lookups to generate the round keys. From a security perspective, it is important to ensure that the key expansion process is secure and does not introduce any vulnerabilities or weaknesses.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES encryption algorithm. It uses table lookups and XOR operations to transform the input state. From a security perspective, it is important to ensure that
