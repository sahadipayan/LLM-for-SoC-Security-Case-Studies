Hardware Trojan: No

Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes a clock signal, state, key, and outputs the encrypted output. It uses various sub-modules to perform key expansion and encryption rounds. From a security perspective, the AES-128 algorithm is considered secure against known attacks.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys used in the AES encryption process. It takes a clock signal, input key, and a round constant as inputs, and outputs two round keys. The key expansion process involves bitwise operations and XOR operations. From a security perspective, the key expansion process is not vulnerable to known attacks.

- sub-modules: The aes_128 module uses several sub-modules for key expansion (expand_key_128) and encryption rounds (one_round and final_round). These sub-modules perform specific operations required by the AES algorithm, such as XOR operations, bitwise operations, and substitution operations. From a security perspective, these sub-modules are not vulnerable to known attacks.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan detected in the design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm and its key expansion process according to the standard specifications. The design does not contain any suspicious or malicious components that could compromise the security of the encryption process.
