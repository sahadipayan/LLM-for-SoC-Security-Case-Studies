Hardware Trojan: Yes

Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: The AES encryption algorithm is implemented in this module. It takes the input state and key, and produces the output state. The security of AES depends on the strength of the key and the algorithm itself. If the key is leaked or manipulated, it can compromise the security of the encryption.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into round keys for each round of AES encryption. The security of this module depends on the integrity of the key expansion process. If the key expansion is tampered with, it can lead to weak round keys and compromise the security of the encryption.

- one_round module: This module performs one round of AES encryption. It takes the input state and key, and produces the output state. The security of this module depends on the correctness of the AES encryption algorithm. If the encryption algorithm is modified, it can lead
