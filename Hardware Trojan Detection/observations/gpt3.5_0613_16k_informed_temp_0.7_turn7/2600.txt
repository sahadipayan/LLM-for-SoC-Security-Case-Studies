Hardware Trojan: No

Explanation: Based on the analysis of the AES design, there is no evidence of a hardware trojan in the design. The design consists of modules that implement the AES algorithm and additional circuits for key expansion and encryption rounds. The modules and operations appear to be implemented in a standard and secure manner, without any suspicious or malicious components. However, a thorough analysis and verification of the design would be required to ensure the absence of any hardware trojans.
