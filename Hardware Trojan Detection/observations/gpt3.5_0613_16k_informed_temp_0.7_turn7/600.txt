Security Analysis: 

aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 block cipher encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, a 128-bit state, and a 128-bit key as inputs, and produces a 128-bit output. The module consists of multiple sub-modules that handle different parts of the encryption process, such as key expansion and rounds of encryption.

expand_key_128 module: This module performs the key expansion process in AES-128. It takes in a clock signal, a 128-bit input key, an 8-bit round constant (rcon), and produces two 128-bit output keys. The module uses a combination of XOR and table lookup operations to generate the expanded keys.

one_round module: This module represents one round of the AES encryption process. It takes in a clock signal, a 128-bit input state, a 128-bit round key, and produces a 128-bit output state. The module applies table lookup operations and XOR operations to the input state and round key to generate the output state.

final_round module: This module represents the final round of the AES encryption process. It takes in a clock signal, a 128-bit input state, a 128-bit input key, and produces a 128-bit output state. The module applies table lookup operations, XOR operations, and additional operations specific to the final round to generate the output state.

module1 module: This module takes in a reset signal, a clock signal, a 128-bit state, and produces an output signal w1. The module sets the output signal w1 to high for two clock cycles when the input state is equal to 128'hFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF, otherwise it sets w1 to low.

module2 module: This module takes in a clock signal, a reset signal, a 128-bit key, and an input signal w1. The module stores the input key in a register called SECRETKey. It also has a counter called COUNTER that increments by 1 on each clock cycle. The output signal w3 is set to the least significant bit of the SECRETKey. The module also includes multiple inverters (INV1_out to INV11_out) that take the inverse of the w3 signal.

Hardware Trojan: No, there is no hardware Trojan found in the design.
