Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: The aes_128 module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes a clock signal as input and has inputs for the state and key, and outputs the encrypted output (out) as well as round keys (rk1 to rk8). The module uses multiple sub-modules to expand the key and perform the encryption rounds.
- expand_key_128 module: The expand_key_128 module takes the clock signal and the input key as inputs and generates the round keys. It uses a series of XOR operations and a shift register to generate the round keys. The module also has an input for the round constant (rcon) which is used in the key expansion process.
- one_round module: The one_round module performs one round of AES encryption. It takes the clock signal and the input state and round key as inputs, and outputs the updated state for the next round. The module uses the AES S-box and various XOR operations to perform the encryption.
- final_round module: The final_round module performs the final round of AES encryption. It takes the clock signal and the input state and round key as inputs, and outputs the final encrypted output. The module uses the AES S-box and various XOR operations to perform the encryption.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm and consists of multiple modules that work together to perform the encryption. Each module has a specific function and there is no indication of any malicious behavior or Trojan functionality.
