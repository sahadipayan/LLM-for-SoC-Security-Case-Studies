Hardware Trojan: Yes

Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 cipher. From a security perspective, the AES-128 algorithm itself is considered secure against known cryptographic attacks.
- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the 128-bit input key into multiple round keys. It uses a key schedule algorithm to generate the round keys. The security of this module depends on the security of the key schedule algorithm used.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes the input state and round key as inputs and produces the output state. The security of this module depends on the security of the AES algorithm itself.
- final_round module: This module performs the final round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes the input state and round key as inputs and produces the output state. The security of this module depends on the security of the AES algorithm itself.

Explanation:
There is no explicit mention of a hardware Trojan in the given design. However, it is important to note that the presence of a hardware Trojan cannot be determined solely based on the provided design code. A thorough analysis of the design's implementation, manufacturing process, and trustworthiness of the supply chain is required to detect the presence of a hardware Trojan.

It is crucial to ensure the integrity of the design and manufacturing process to prevent the insertion of hardware Trojans. Regular security audits, supply chain verification, and adherence to trusted design and manufacturing practices are necessary to mitigate the risk of hardware Trojans.
