Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: The aes_128 module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. From a security perspective, the module appears to be designed to provide secure encryption. However, without further analysis of the specific implementation details and the cryptographic properties of the AES algorithm, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive security analysis.

- expand_key_128 module: The expand_key_128 module is responsible for expanding the input key into a set of round keys used in the AES encryption process. From a security perspective, the module appears to perform the key expansion correctly and does not raise any immediate security concerns.

Explanation: Based on the provided code, there is no evidence of a hardware Trojan in the design. The code appears to implement the AES encryption algorithm and its key expansion correctly. However, a thorough analysis of the entire design, including the implementation details and any potential vulnerabilities, would be required to provide a definitive assessment of the design's security.
