Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
1. aes_128 Module: This is the main module where the AES-128 encryption takes place. It takes in the state and key as inputs and outputs the encrypted data. The key is expanded using the expand_key_128 module and then used in the one_round and final_round modules to encrypt the data. There doesn't seem to be any hardware Trojan in this module.

2. expand_key_128 Module: This module is used for key expansion in AES-128. It takes in the original key and a round constant as inputs and outputs the expanded key. The key is expanded by XORing the original key with a shifted and substituted version of itself. There doesn't seem to be any hardware Trojan in this module either.

3. one_round and final_round Modules: These modules are used for the actual encryption of the data. They take in the state and the expanded key as inputs and output the encrypted data. There doesn't seem to be any hardware Trojan in these modules.

Explanation: After analyzing the provided AES-128 design, it can be concluded that there is no hardware Trojan in the design. All the modules seem to be performing their intended functions without any malicious activities. The key is properly expanded and used for encryption, and the encrypted data is correctly outputted.
