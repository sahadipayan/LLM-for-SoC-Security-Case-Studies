Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: The aes_128 module implements the AES-128 block cipher algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, and key as inputs, and produces the encrypted output as the output. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform key expansion, one round encryption, and final round encryption.

- expand_key_128 module: The expand_key_128 module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys. It takes in a clock signal, input key, and rcon (round constant) as inputs, and produces two round keys as outputs. The module uses a combination of XOR and table lookup operations to generate the round keys.

- one_round module: The one_round module performs one round of encryption in the AES algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, input state, key, and produces the output state after one round of encryption. The module uses table lookup and XOR operations to perform the encryption.

- final_round module: The final_round module performs the final round of encryption in the AES algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, input state, key, and produces the final encrypted output state. The module uses table lookup and XOR operations similar to the one_round module.

- module1 module: The module1 module is a custom module that takes in a reset signal, clock signal, input state, and produces an output signal w1. The module sets w1 high for two clock cycles when the input state is all ones (128'hFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF), and low otherwise.

- module2 module: The module2 module is another custom module that takes in a clock signal, reset signal, input key, and w1 signal. The module also has an internal counter and a SECRETKey register. The module sets w3 based on the least significant bit of the SECRETKey register. The module also has several inverters that generate INV1_out to INV11_out signals based on the value of w3.

Hardware Trojan: No hardware trojan is present in the design.
