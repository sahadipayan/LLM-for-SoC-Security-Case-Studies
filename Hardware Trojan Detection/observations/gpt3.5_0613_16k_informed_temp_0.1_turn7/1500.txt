Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: The aes_128 module implements the AES-128 block cipher algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, and key as inputs, and produces the encrypted output (out) and round keys (rk1-rk8) as outputs. The module consists of various sub-modules that perform different operations such as key expansion, one round encryption, and final round encryption.

- expand_key_128 module: The expand_key_128 module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys. It takes in the clock signal, input key, and rcon (round constant) as inputs, and produces two sets of round keys (out_1 and out_2) as outputs. The module uses a combination of XOR and shift operations to generate the round keys.

- one_round module: The one_round module performs one round of encryption in the AES algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, input state, and round key as inputs, and produces the output state after one round of encryption. The module uses table lookups and XOR operations to perform the encryption.

- final_round module: The final_round module performs the final round of encryption in the AES algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, input state, and key as inputs, and produces the output state after the final round of encryption. The module uses table lookups and XOR operations similar to the one_round module.

- module1 module: The module1 module is responsible for generating a control signal (w1) based on the clock signal and a counter. The counter is incremented after each clock cycle, and when it reaches a specific value, the control signal is set to 1. Otherwise, the control signal is set to 0.

- module2 module: The module2 module consists of multiple sub-modules that implement different operations based on the control signal (w1) generated by module1. These operations involve bitwise AND and XOR operations between the state and round keys, and the shifting of shift registers based on the control signal.

Hardware Trojan: No, there is no hardware trojan in the design.
