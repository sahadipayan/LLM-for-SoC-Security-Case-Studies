Hardware Trojan: No

Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes a clock signal, state, key as inputs, and produces the encrypted output as out. It uses various internal wires and registers to perform the encryption rounds. From a security perspective, the AES-128 algorithm is considered secure and widely used in cryptographic applications.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys. It takes a clock signal, input key, and round constant (rcon) as inputs, and produces two output round keys (out_1 and out_2). It uses internal wires and registers to perform the key expansion. The key expansion process is an important part of the AES algorithm and is designed to ensure the security of the encryption.

Explanation: 
There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm, which is a well-known and widely used cryptographic algorithm. The modules in the design perform the necessary operations to encrypt the input data using the provided key. The expand_key_128 module expands the input key into multiple round keys, which are used in the encryption process. The design does not contain any suspicious or malicious components that could compromise the security of the encryption.
