Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES encryption algorithm. It takes the clock signal, state, key as inputs and produces the encrypted output and round keys as outputs. The security of AES depends on the strength of the key and the resistance against various attacks such as differential power analysis (DPA) and side-channel attacks. The design of this module does not show any obvious vulnerabilities or weaknesses that could be exploited by attackers.
- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for generating the round keys used in AES encryption. It takes the clock signal, input key, and round constant as inputs and produces two sets of round keys as outputs. The security of the key expansion process is crucial for the overall security of AES. The design of this module appears to be secure as it follows the standard key expansion algorithm specified in the AES standard.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of AES encryption. It takes the clock signal, input state, and round key as inputs and produces
