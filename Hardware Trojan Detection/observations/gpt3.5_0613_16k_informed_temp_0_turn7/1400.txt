Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 block cipher algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, key, and outputs the encrypted output (out) and round keys (rk1-rk8). The module consists of several sub-modules that perform key expansion and encryption rounds.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys. It takes in a clock signal, input key (in), and rcon (round constant) and outputs two round keys (out_1 and out_2). The module uses a combination of XOR and shift operations to generate the round keys.

- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, key, and outputs the updated state for the next round. The module uses a combination of substitution, permutation, and XOR operations to update the state.

- final_round module: This module performs the final round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, key, and outputs the encrypted output. The module uses a combination of substitution, permutation, and XOR operations to update the state and generate the final encrypted output.

Hardware Trojan: No

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design implements the AES-128 block cipher algorithm and its key expansion and encryption rounds. The modules perform the necessary operations to ensure the security of the encryption process.
