Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: The AES design consists of three modules - aes_128, expand_key_128, and S4. 

The aes_128 module is the main AES encryption module. It takes a clock signal, input state and key, and produces the encrypted output. The module also includes registers to store intermediate values and assigns statements to connect these registers with the input and output ports. The module does not have any security vulnerabilities or trojans.

The expand_key_128 module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys. It takes a clock signal, input key, and round constant as inputs, and produces two round keys as outputs. The module includes wire connections to perform various operations on the input key and round constant, and assigns statements to connect these wires with the output ports. The module does not have any security vulnerabilities or trojans.

The S4 module is a sub-module used within the expand_key_128 module. It takes a clock signal and a subset of the input key as inputs, and produces a modified subset of the key as output. The module includes wire connections to perform operations on the input key, and an assign statement to connect the output wire with the output port. The module does not have any security vulnerabilities or trojans.

Explanation: There is no hardware trojan present in the design. The design follows standard AES encryption algorithms and does not include any malicious or hidden functionality.
