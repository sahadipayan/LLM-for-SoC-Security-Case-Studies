Security Analysis: 

1. `aes_128` module: This is an implementation of AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with a key size of 128 bits. It seems secure, as it follows the standard symmetric encryption algorithm.

2. `expand_key_128` module: This module is used for key expansion in AES. It also appears to be secure based on standard AES techniques.

3. `one_round` module: This module appears to perform one round of AES encryption, including substitution, permutation, and combination with the key. This is a standard part of AES and is considered secure.

4. `final_round` module: This module performs the final round of AES encryption, which is slightly different from the other rounds. It also appears to follow standard AES procedures, and is considered secure.

5. `module1` module: This module appears to have a shift register that shifts when the state equals a certain value. This could potentially be a security risk if an attacker can control the state, as it could allow them to manipulate the operation of the module.

Hardware Trojan: Yes

Explanation: The hardware trojan is found in the `module1`. The trojan is in the always block that controls the shift register `w2`. When the state is equal to `128'h00112233_44556677_8899aabb_ccddeeff`, `w1` is set to 1 which causes `w2` to shift. If an attacker can control the state, they can cause the shift register to shift at will. This could potentially be used to disrupt the operation of the system or leak information. 
The hardware Trojan is an information leak type as it leaks the internal state of the shift register `w2` by making it visible externally. This shift register could hold sensitive data such as encryption keys or confidential information.
