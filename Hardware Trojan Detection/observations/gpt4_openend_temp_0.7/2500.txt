Security Analysis: 

1. The main module 'aes_128' begins by setting up input and output parameters, and initializing a variety of registers. The code then outlines a method for expanding the 128-bit key and executing the AES cipher rounds. However, there's no clear validation or sanitization on input data, which could potentially allow for buffer overflow attacks or other forms of input manipulation.

2. The 'expand_key_128' module is responsible for key expansion. It takes the initial key and, through a series of operations, expands it to the necessary size for the AES cipher. Again, there's no clear validation or sanitization on input data.

3. The 'one_round' module performs one round of the AES cipher. This includes the SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, and AddRoundKey steps. No explicit security measures are noted in this module.

4. The 'final_round' module executes the final round of the AES cipher. This includes the SubBytes, ShiftRows, and AddRoundKey steps, but not the MixColumns step, as per AES specification. No explicit security measures are noted in this module.

5. The 'module1' is a simple counter module that increments a 4-bit counter on every clock cycle. This module seems out of place in an AES design and its purpose is unclear.

Hardware Torjan: Yes

Explanation: 

The potential Hardware Trojan in this design is 'module1'. It is a simple counter that increments on every clock cycle. The output of this counter is then XORed with the output of the AES encryption in the 'aes_128' module. This can potentially change the output of the AES encryption in an unpredictable manner, which could be used as a backdoor to leak information or interfere with the encryption process. The counter is also not reset or controlled in any way, making it unpredictable and potentially dangerous.
