Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes a clock signal, state, key as inputs, and produces the encrypted output as well as the round keys rk1 to rk8. The module consists of sub-modules for key expansion, one round encryption, and the final round encryption. There is no apparent security vulnerability in this module.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the original key into multiple round keys. It takes a clock signal, the original key, and a round constant as inputs, and produces two sets of round keys. The module performs key expansion using XOR and shift operations. There is no apparent security vulnerability in this module.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm and its key expansion process. Both modules appear to be secure and do not exhibit any malicious behavior.
