Hardware Trojan: Yes
Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: The AES-128 module is responsible for encrypting the input state using the provided key. It follows the standard AES encryption algorithm and does not introduce any security vulnerabilities on its own.
- expand_key_128 module: The expand_key_128 module is responsible for generating the round keys used in the AES encryption process. It takes the input key and performs key expansion using a series of XOR operations with round constants. This module does not introduce any security vulnerabilities on its own.
- one_round module: The one_round module performs one round of AES encryption. It takes the input state and round key, performs table lookups and XOR operations to produce the output state. This module follows the standard AES encryption algorithm and does not introduce any security vulnerabilities
