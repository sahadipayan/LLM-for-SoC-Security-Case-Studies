Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes a clock signal, state, and key as inputs, and produces the encrypted output as the output. The module uses various sub-modules to perform key expansion and multiple rounds of encryption. From a security perspective, the AES algorithm is considered secure against known attacks.
- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys. It takes the clock signal, input key, and a round constant as inputs, and produces two round keys as outputs. The module uses a combination of XOR operations and table lookups to generate the round keys. From a security perspective, the key expansion process is an essential part of the AES algorithm and is designed to ensure the security of the encryption.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes the clock signal, input state, and round key as inputs, and produces the updated state as the output. The module uses table lookups and XOR operations to update the state. From a security perspective, each round of the AES algorithm is designed to provide confusion and diffusion properties, making it resistant to known attacks.
- final_round module: This module performs the final round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes the clock signal, input state, and final round key as inputs, and produces the final encrypted output as the output. The module uses table lookups and XOR operations similar to the one_round module. From a security perspective, the final round ensures the completion of the encryption process and provides additional security against attacks.
- module1 module: This module introduces a temporary signal w1 that is high for two clock cycles when the state is all ones (128'hFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF). This signal is used as an input in module2. From a security perspective, this module does not introduce any security vulnerabilities or trojans.
- module2 module: This module uses the temporary signal w1 from module1 and the input key to generate multiple inverted signals (INV1_out to INV11_out). These inverted signals do not have any direct impact on the encryption process and do not introduce any security vulnerabilities or trojans.
Explanation: There is no hardware trojan in the design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm and its associated components, which are widely used and considered secure against known attacks.
