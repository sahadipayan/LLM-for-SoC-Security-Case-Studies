Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, key, and outputs the encrypted output. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform different operations such as key expansion and rounds of encryption. From a security perspective, the AES algorithm is considered secure and widely used in various applications.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys used in the AES encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, input key, and outputs two round keys. The module uses a combination of XOR operations and bit shifting to generate the round keys. From a security perspective, the key expansion process is an essential part of the AES algorithm and does not introduce any vulnerabilities.

- sub-modules: The aes_128 module uses several sub-modules for key expansion (expand_key_128) and encryption rounds (one_round and final_round). These sub-modules perform specific operations based on the AES algorithm and do not introduce any security vulnerabilities.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm and its key expansion process, which are standard and widely used cryptographic techniques. The design does not include any suspicious or malicious components that could compromise the security of the encryption process.
