Hardware Trojan: Yes
Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. From a security perspective, it is important to ensure that the implementation follows the AES standard and does not introduce any vulnerabilities or weaknesses. The module uses a key schedule expansion module (expand_key_128) to generate round keys, and one_round and final_round modules to perform the encryption rounds. It is crucial to verify that these sub-modules are implemented correctly and do not introduce any security flaws.

- expand_key_128 module: This module expands the input key into round keys using the AES key schedule algorithm. It is important to ensure that the key expansion algorithm is implemented correctly and does not introduce any vulnerabilities or weaknesses. The module uses a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) counter to generate round constants. It is important to verify that the LFSR counter is implemented securely and does not introduce any vulnerabilities or weaknesses.
