Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes the clock signal, state, key as inputs and produces the encrypted output (out) and round keys (rk1-rk8). The module performs key expansion and multiple rounds of encryption using the sub-modules expand_key_128, one_round, and final_round. From a security perspective, the AES-128 algorithm is considered secure and widely used in various applications.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the original key into multiple round keys. It takes the clock signal, input key, and round constant (rcon) as inputs and produces two sets of round keys (out_1 and out_2). The module uses a combination of XOR and table lookups to generate the round keys. The security of the key expansion process is crucial for the overall security of the AES algorithm. However, without further information about the specific implementation of the key expansion algorithm, it is difficult to perform
