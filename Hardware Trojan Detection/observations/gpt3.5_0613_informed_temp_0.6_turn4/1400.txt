Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
1. aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. From a security perspective, the implementation of AES-128 is generally considered secure if implemented correctly. However, without analyzing the specific implementation details of this module, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive security analysis.

2. expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into round keys for each round of the AES algorithm. From a security perspective, the key expansion process is critical to the security of the encryption algorithm. If the key expansion is implemented correctly, it should not introduce any vulnerabilities or weaknesses. However, without analyzing the specific implementation details of this module, it is difficult to provide a comprehensive security analysis.

Explanation: No hardware trojan is present in the design. The design consists of modules that implement the AES-128 encryption algorithm and the key expansion process. Without analyzing the specific implementation details of these modules, it is not possible to determine if there are any hardware trojans present.
