1. aes_128 Module:
   - This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm.
   - It takes a clock signal, reset signal, state (plaintext or ciphertext), and key as inputs.
   - It generates the encrypted output (out) using the AES algorithm.
   - The key schedule is generated by the expand_key_128 module, which expands the initial key into a set of round keys.
   - The one_round module performs the encryption for each round of the AES algorithm.
   - The final_round module performs the encryption for the final round of the AES algorithm.

2. expand_key_128 Module:
   - This module generates the round keys used in the AES algorithm.
   - It takes a clock signal, input key, and round constant (rcon) as inputs.
   - It generates two sets of round keys (out_1 and out_2) using the key expansion algorithm.
   - The key expansion algorithm involves XORing the input key with the round constant, performing byte-wise substitutions, and shifting rows.

3. lfsr_counter Module:
   - This module implements a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) counter.
   - It takes a clock signal, reset signal, and data as inputs.
   - It generates a 20-bit LFSR counter (lfsr) using the input data.
   - The LFSR counter is used in the module1 module for generating a pseudo-random sequence.

4. module1 Module:
   - This module generates a pseudo-random sequence based on the input key and LFSR counter.
   - It takes a reset signal, clock signal, key, and data as inputs.
   - It generates a 64-bit load signal based on the key and the bits of the LFSR counter.
   - The load signal is used for an unknown purpose in the design
