Hardware Trojan: No

Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. From a security perspective, the AES algorithm itself is considered to be secure against various attacks. However, the security of the implementation also depends on the key generation and key expansion process, which is implemented in the expand_key_128 module.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for generating the round keys used in the AES encryption algorithm. It takes the input key and performs key expansion using the Rijndael key schedule. The key expansion process involves XOR operations, substitution, and permutation operations. From a security perspective, the key expansion process is crucial as any weakness or vulnerability in this process could compromise the security of the entire encryption algorithm.

Explanation: 
There is no hardware Trojan detected in the given design. The design appears to be a straightforward implementation of the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It consists of two main modules: aes_128 and expand_key_128. The aes_128 module performs the encryption process, while the expand_key_128 module handles the key expansion process.

It is important to note that the absence of a hardware Trojan cannot be definitively determined solely by analyzing the design code. Further analysis and verification techniques, such as physical inspection of the hardware or testing for potential side-channel attacks, would be required to confirm the absence of any hardware Trojan.
