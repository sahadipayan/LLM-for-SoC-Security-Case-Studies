Hardware Trojan: Yes
Security Analysis:
- expand_key_128 module: This module takes in the input key and generates the round keys for each round of AES encryption. It uses an 8-bit shift register and a lookup table to perform the key expansion. From a security perspective, this module does not introduce any vulnerabilities.

- one_round module: This module performs one round of AES encryption. It takes in the state and the round key as inputs and produces the intermediate state after the substitution, permutation, and key addition steps. Again, from a security perspective, this module does not introduce any vulnerabilities.

- final_round module: This module performs the final round of AES encryption. It is similar to the one_round module but with slight differences in the key addition step. Like the previous modules, this module does not introduce any vulnerabilities.

Explanation:
Although the design itself does not contain any hardware trojans, it is important to note that the presence of hardware trojans cannot be determined solely by analyzing the design code. Hardware trojans can be inserted during the fabrication process by malicious actors, and their presence may not be detectable through design analysis alone.

In this specific design, the presence of trojans would require a physical inspection of the fabricated hardware and an analysis of its behavior during operation. Without such analysis, it is not possible to determine if hardware trojans are present.

Therefore, while the design itself does not contain any known trojans, it is important to consider the broader manufacturing and supply chain security aspects to ensure the integrity of the implemented hardware.
