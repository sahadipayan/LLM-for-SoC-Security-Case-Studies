Hardware Trojan: Yes
Security Analysis:
1. aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. From a security perspective, it is important to ensure that the implementation is correct and resistant to known attacks on AES. The module appears to be implementing AES correctly according to the standard, but a thorough security analysis would require verifying that the implementation does not have any vulnerabilities or weaknesses.

2. expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the key used in the AES algorithm. It takes the initial key and generates a set of round keys. From a security perspective, it is important that the key expansion is performed correctly and does not introduce any vulnerabilities or weaknesses. The module appears to be implementing the key expansion correctly according to the standard, but a thorough security analysis would require
