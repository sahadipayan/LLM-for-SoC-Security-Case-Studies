Hardware Trojan: No

Security Analysis: 

1. aes_128 module: This module is the top-level module of the design. It takes in a 128-bit state and key as inputs and produces a 128-bit output. It also generates 8 round keys (rk1-rk8). It uses a series of expand_key_128 and one_round modules to perform the AES encryption. The expand_key_128 module is used to expand the key for each round of encryption, and the one_round module is used to perform one round of encryption. The final_round module is used for the last round of encryption.

2. expand_key_128 module: This module takes in a 128-bit input and a 8-bit round constant (rcon) and produces two 128-bit outputs. It uses a series of XOR operations and a S4 module to perform the key expansion. The S4 module is used to perform a substitution operation on the key.

From a security perspective, this design seems secure as it follows the standard AES encryption algorithm. The key and state are not exposed at any point and are always encrypted or XORed with other data. The key expansion is done securely using the expand_key_128 module. The encryption is done securely using the one_round and final_round modules.

Explanation: As per the given design, there is no hardware trojan in the design. A hardware trojan would involve some sort of malicious modification to the design that could leak information or allow unauthorized access. For example, a trojan could involve adding extra logic that sends the key or state to an external output. However, in this design, there is no such modification. The design follows the standard AES encryption algorithm and does not have any extra logic that could potentially be a trojan.
