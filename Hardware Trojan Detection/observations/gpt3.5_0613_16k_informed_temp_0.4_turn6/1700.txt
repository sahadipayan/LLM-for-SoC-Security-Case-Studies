Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state (plaintext), key, and outputs the encrypted output. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform key expansion, one round of encryption, and the final round of encryption.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into a set of round keys. It takes in a clock signal, input key, and a round constant (rcon). It outputs two sets of round keys. The module performs key expansion using bitwise operations and XOR operations.

- one_round module: This module performs one round of AES encryption. It takes in a clock signal, state (plaintext), round key, and outputs the intermediate state. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform substitution, permutation, and XOR operations.

- final_round module: This module performs the final round of AES encryption. It takes in a clock signal, state (plaintext), round key, and outputs the encrypted output. The module performs the same operations as the one_round module but without the MixColumns operation.

Hardware Trojan: No hardware trojan is present in the design.

Explanation: There is no hardware trojan present in the design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm in a straightforward manner without any malicious or unintended functionality.
