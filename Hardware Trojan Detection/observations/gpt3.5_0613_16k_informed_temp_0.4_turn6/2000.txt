Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, and key as inputs, and produces the encrypted output as the output. The module consists of various sub-modules that perform different operations of the AES algorithm, such as key expansion and one round encryption.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys. It takes in a clock signal, input key, and a round constant as inputs, and produces two round keys as outputs. The module uses a shift register and XOR operations to generate the round keys.

- one_round module: This module performs one round of AES encryption. It takes in a clock signal, input state, and round key as inputs, and produces the updated state as the output. The module uses table lookups and XOR operations to perform the encryption.

- final_round module: This module performs the final round of AES encryption. It takes in a clock signal, input state, and final round key as inputs, and produces the final encrypted state as the output. The module uses table lookups and XOR operations similar to the one_round module.

- module1 module: This module implements a state machine that checks for specific values of the input state. It takes in a reset signal and input state as inputs, and produces a control signal w1 as the output. The module sets different states based on the input state values.

- module2 module: This module implements another state machine that operates based on the control signal w1 and a counter value. It takes in a clock signal, reset signal, input key, and control signal w1 as inputs, and produces an output signal w2. The module shifts the input key based on the control signal and generates inverted output signals.

Hardware Trojan: No

Explanation: There is no hardware trojan present in the design. The design consists of standard AES encryption modules and state machines that perform the encryption operations. There are no additional circuits or functionalities that could potentially introduce a trojan.
