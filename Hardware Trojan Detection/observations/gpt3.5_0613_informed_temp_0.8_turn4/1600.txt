Hardware Trojan: Yes
Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: The AES algorithm itself is considered to be secure. However, the security of this module depends on the implementation of the AES algorithm. If the implementation is correct and follows the AES standard, then the module should be secure.
- expand_key_128 module: This module performs the key expansion for the AES algorithm. If the key expansion is implemented correctly and follows the AES standard, then the module should be secure.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES algorithm. If the round function is implemented correctly and follows the AES standard, then the module should be secure.
- final_round module: This module performs the final round of the AES algorithm. If the final round function is implemented correctly and follows the AES standard, then the module should be secure.

Explanation:
Based on the given design, there is no direct indication of a hardware Trojan. However, it is important to note that the security of the design depends on the implementation of each module and the adherence to the AES standard. If any of the modules have been modified to include a hardware Trojan, it would require a detailed analysis of the module's functionality and the specific changes made to determine the nature of the Trojan and how it operates.
