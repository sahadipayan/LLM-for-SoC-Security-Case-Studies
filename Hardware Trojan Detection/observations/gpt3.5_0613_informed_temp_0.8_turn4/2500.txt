Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the 128-bit key into a set of round keys. It takes the input key and performs operations such as XOR, table lookup, and assignment to generate the round keys. From a security perspective, this module does not seem to have any vulnerabilities or potential trojans.

- one_round module: This module represents one round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes the state and key as inputs, performs table lookups, XOR operations, and assignments to generate the output state. Similar to the expand_key_128 module, there are no apparent security vulnerabilities or trojans in this module.

- final_round module: This module represents the final round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes the state and key as inputs and performs table lookups, XOR operations, and assignments to generate the output state. Similar to the previous modules, there are no apparent security vulnerabilities or trojans in this module.

- module1 module: This module is a simple 4-bit counter. It increments by 1 on each positive clock edge. From a security perspective, this module does not have any vulnerabilities or potential trojans.

Explanation: No hardware trojan is present in the design. Each module performs its intended functionality without any malicious behavior or vulnerabilities.
