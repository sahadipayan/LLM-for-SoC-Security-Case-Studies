Hardware Trojan: Yes

Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: The aes_128 module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes inputs of the clock signal, state, and key, and produces the encrypted output 'out' and round keys 'rk1' to 'rk8'. The security analysis of this module would involve analyzing the security of the AES algorithm itself, which is beyond the scope of this analysis.

- expand_key_128 module: The expand_key_128 module is responsible for expanding the original key into multiple round keys. It takes inputs of the clock signal, input key 'in', and round constant 'rcon', and produces two output round keys 'out_1' and 'out_2'. The security analysis of this module would involve analyzing the security of the key expansion algorithm, which is again beyond the scope of this analysis.

Explanation:
Based on the given information, it is not possible to determine if there is a hardware trojan in the design. The provided code only includes the modules responsible for implementing the AES algorithm and key expansion, and there is no explicit information or evidence about the presence of a hardware trojan.

To determine the presence of a hardware trojan, a thorough analysis of the design at a gate level or physical level would be required. This would involve examining the circuitry, components, and connections to identify any suspicious or malicious elements that could potentially comprise a hardware trojan.

Therefore, without additional information or evidence, it cannot be conclusively stated whether there is a hardware trojan in the design or how it operates.
