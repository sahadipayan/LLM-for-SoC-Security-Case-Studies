Hardware Trojan: Yes

Security Analysis:
1. 'top' module: This module contains the main AES module and another module named 'module1'. The input and output are well defined and seem secure. But the connection of 'module1' is not clear, which raises suspicion.

2. 'aes_128' module: This is the main module that performs AES encryption. It is an intricate module, consisting of multiple stages of transformations, including key expansion and round transformations. From a security perspective, if implemented correctly, this provides robust encryption. There doesn't appear to be a hardware Trojan in this module.

3. 'expand_key_128' module: This module performs key expansion, a crucial part of the AES algorithm. It appears to be secure and does not seem to contain a hardware Trojan.

4. 'one_round' module and 'final_round' module: These modules perform the round transformations and the final round transformation respectively in AES encryption. They also seem to be secure and do not contain a hardware Trojan.

5. 'module1': This is a suspicious module. It doesn't seem to have a direct relation to the AES algorithm. The operation of this module is controlled by a specific state value. When it receives this specific state value, it starts to shift a pre-defined value cyclically. 

Explanation: The hardware Trojan exists in the 'module1'. It is a type of sequence-based Trojan, specifically a state-based trigger. When the 'state' input matches a particular value, 'module1' starts to shift a pre-defined value. This can be potentially harmful because it can be used to leak information or trigger some specific behavior under certain conditions. This Trojan operates silently and will not affect the normal operation of the AES encryption unless the specific state value is inputted. This makes it hard to detect.
