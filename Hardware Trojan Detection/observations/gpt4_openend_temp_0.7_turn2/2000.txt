Hardware Trojan: Yes

Security Analysis: 

1. `top` Module: This is the top-level module which includes the `aes_128`, `module1`, and `module2` sub-modules. There are no apparent security vulnerabilities in it.

2. `aes_128` Module: This module seems to be an implementation of the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It doesn't appear to have any security vulnerabilities.

3. `expand_key_128` Module: This module is responsible for the AES key expansion, which is a crucial part of AES encryption. No apparent security vulnerabilities are found.

4. `one_round` and `final_round` Modules: These modules implement one round and the final round of AES encryption respectively. They appear secure.

5. `module1`: This module generates a signal `w1` based on specific sequences of the `state` input. It is not clear what purpose this serves in the context of the AES algorithm. This could potentially be part of a Trojan.

6. `module2`: This module significantly alters the `SECRETKey` based on the `w1` signal from `module1` and a counter. This is highly unusual for an AES implementation, and it strongly suggests the presence of a hardware Trojan.

Explanation: 

The hardware Trojan seems to be spread across `module1` and `module2`. `module1` is looking for a specific sequence of the `state` input to set the `w1` signal. Once the `w1` signal is set, `module2` starts to manipulate the `SECRETKey`. This manipulation involves shifting the bits of the `SECRETKey` to the right every time the `w1` signal changes or the counter reaches its maximum value. This could potentially leak the secret key or at least some of its bits. It could also possibly alter the encryption process, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, this design does contain a hardware Trojan.
