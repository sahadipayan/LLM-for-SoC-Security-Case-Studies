Hardware Trojan: Yes
Security Analysis: 
1. aes_128 module: This is the top-level module which includes input and output ports for the AES 128-bit encryption algorithm. It also includes the clock and reset signals. It has state and key as inputs and out as output. The key expansion and AES rounds are performed in this module. This module appears to be secure, but it's necessary to examine its sub-modules for potential security issues.

2. expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for the key expansion process, which involves generating round keys for each round of AES. It does not seem to have any obvious security issues.

3. one_round module: This module is responsible for a single round of the AES algorithm. Each round involves several transformations (SubBytes, ShiftRows, MixColumns, AddRoundKey) and this module seems to perform these transformations correctly.

4. final_round module: This module is responsible for the final round of AES, which is slightly different from the other rounds. It appears to be implementing the transformations correctly.

5. module1: This is the module where the hardware trojan is hidden. It takes two specific bits from round 2 and round 5 of AES and performs an AND operation on them. The output of this operation is then XORed with the least significant bit of the AES output.

Explanation: 
The hardware trojan operates by subtly altering the output of the AES encryption. It takes the 89th bit from round 2 and the 121st bit from round 5 and performs an AND operation on them. The result of this operation is then XORed with the least significant bit of the AES output. This has the potential to subtly alter the output of the AES encryption in a way that would go unnoticed by most tests, but could be exploited by an attacker who knows about the trojan. This could be used to create a covert channel, where the attacker can extract information from the encrypted data.
