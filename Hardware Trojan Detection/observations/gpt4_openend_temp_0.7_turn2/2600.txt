Hardware Trojan: Yes
Security Analysis: 

1. aes_128: This is the main AES module which connects all the submodules. It does not appear to contain any security vulnerabilities in itself.

2. expand_key_128: This module is responsible for expanding the key. It doesn't appear to have any security vulnerabilities on its own.

3. module1: This module is a potential hardware Trojan. It is not a part of the standard AES design. This module takes as its input the 122nd bit of the 3rd round state and an output from the main AES module. It increments a counter every time the 122nd bit of the 3rd round state is '1'. The most significant bit of this counter is then XORed with the least significant bit of the final output. This could potentially leak information about the internal state of the encryption process.

4. one_round: This is the implementation of one round of AES. It seems to be implemented correctly and does not appear to contain any security vulnerabilities.

5. final_round: This is the implementation of the final round of AES. It seems to be implemented correctly and does not appear to contain any security vulnerabilities.

Explanation: The hardware Trojan in the design is the module1. It is not a part of the standard AES design. The Trojan operates by monitoring the 122nd bit of the 3rd round state and incrementing a counter every time this bit is '1'. The most significant bit of this counter is then XORed with the least significant bit of the final output. This means that the output of the AES encryption is potentially modified by the internal state of the encryption process, which could lead to information leakage. This could be exploited by an attacker to gain information about the key or plaintext.
