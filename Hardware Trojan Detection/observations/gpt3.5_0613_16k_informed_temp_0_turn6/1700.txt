Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes a clock signal, state input (plaintext), key input, and produces the encrypted output. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform key expansion and encryption rounds.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into round keys used in the encryption process. It takes a clock signal, input key, and produces two sets of round keys as outputs. The key expansion process involves XOR operations and substitution operations.

- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes a clock signal, state input, round key input, and produces the intermediate state output. The round operation involves substitution, permutation, and XOR operations.

- final_round module: This module performs the final round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes a clock signal, state input, round key input, and produces the encrypted output. The final round operation is similar to the one_round module but without the MixColumns operation.

Hardware Trojan: No hardware trojan is present in the design.

Explanation: There is no hardware trojan present in the design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm and its key expansion process. The modules perform the encryption operations in a secure manner without any malicious behavior.
