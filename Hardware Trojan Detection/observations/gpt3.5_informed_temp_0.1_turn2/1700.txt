Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, key, and outputs the encrypted output. The module consists of several sub-modules for key expansion, one round encryption, and final round encryption. From a security perspective, the module appears to be implementing the AES algorithm correctly without any obvious vulnerabilities.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys used in the AES encryption process. It takes in a clock signal, input key, and a round constant. The module performs key expansion using XOR operations and shift operations. From a security perspective, the module appears to be correctly implementing the key expansion process without any obvious vulnerabilities.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design consists of modules that implement the AES encryption algorithm and key expansion process. These modules appear to be implemented correctly without any obvious vulnerabilities.
