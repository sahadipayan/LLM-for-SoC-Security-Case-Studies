Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, and key as inputs, and produces the encrypted output as the output. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform different operations such as key expansion and rounds of encryption. From a security perspective, the AES algorithm is considered secure and has been extensively analyzed for vulnerabilities. However, it is always important to ensure that the key used for encryption is kept secure and not leaked.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into round keys used in the AES encryption algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, input key, and a round constant as inputs, and produces two round keys as outputs. The module uses a combination of bitwise operations and table lookups to perform the key expansion. From a security perspective, the key expansion process is crucial for the security of the AES algorithm, and any vulnerabilities in this module could potentially compromise the security of the encryption.

- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, input state, key, and produces the output state after one round of encryption. The module consists of several sub-modules that perform operations such as table lookups and XOR operations. From a security perspective, each round of the AES algorithm is designed to provide strong encryption, and any vulnerabilities in this module could potentially compromise the security of the encryption.

- final_round module: This module performs the final round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, input state, key, and produces the final encrypted output state. The module is similar to the one_round module but with slight differences in the operations performed. From a security perspective, the final round is designed to provide additional security and ensure the integrity of the encrypted data.
