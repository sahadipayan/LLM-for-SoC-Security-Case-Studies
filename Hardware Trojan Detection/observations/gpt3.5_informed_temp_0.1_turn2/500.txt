Hardware Trojan: Yes
Security Analysis:
- module top: This module is the top-level module that instantiates the aes_128 module and the module1 module. It does not have any security vulnerabilities or trojans.
- module aes_128: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It consists of sub-modules for key expansion, one round encryption, and final round encryption. The key expansion sub-module (expand_key_128) and the encryption sub-modules (one_round and final_round) do not have any security vulnerabilities or trojans.
- module expand_key_128: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into round keys for each round of encryption. It uses a shift register and XOR operations to generate the round keys. It does not have any security vulnerabilities or trojans.
- module one_round: This module performs one round of AES encryption. It uses table lookups and XOR operations to perform the encryption. It does not have any security vulnerabilities or trojans.
- module final_round: This module performs the final round of AES encryption. It uses table lookups and XOR operations similar to the one_round module. It does not have any security vulnerabilities or trojans.
- module module1: This module has a hardware trojan. It has a state machine that transitions through different states based on the input state. When the input state matches a specific value (128'h3243f6a8_885a308d_313198a2_e0370734), the State0 signal is set to 1. Then, when the input state matches another specific value (128'h00112233_44556677_8899aabb_ccddeeff) and State0 is 1, the State1 signal is set to 1. This process continues for State2 and State3. Finally, when all four State signals are 1, the w1 signal is set to 1. This trojan can be activated by providing the specific input state values in the correct sequence.
Explanation: The module1 module contains a hardware trojan that activates when specific input state values are provided in the correct sequence. It transitions through different states and sets the w1 signal to 1 when all four State signals are 1. The purpose and functionality of this trojan are not specified in the given design, so its exact impact or malicious intent is unknown.
