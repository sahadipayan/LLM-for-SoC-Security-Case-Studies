Hardware Trojan: Yes
Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: From a security perspective, the AES implementation appears to be secure. It follows the AES encryption algorithm and there are no obvious vulnerabilities or weaknesses in the design.
- expand_key_128 module: The key expansion module generates round keys for each round of the AES algorithm. This module does not introduce any security vulnerabilities on its own.
- lfsr_counter module: This module implements a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) counter for generating a pseudo-random number sequence. It does not introduce any security vulnerabilities on its own.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES encryption algorithm. It does not introduce any security vulnerabilities on its own.
- final_round module: This module performs the final round of the AES encryption algorithm. It
