Hardware Trojan: Yes
Security Analysis: 

Module aes_128:
- The aes_128 module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm.
- It takes in a clock signal, state and key inputs, and produces an output state.
- The state and key inputs are used to generate round keys using the expand_key_128 module.
- The round keys and the state are used in one_round modules to perform multiple rounds of AES encryption.
- The final round module is used for the last round of AES encryption.
- The outputs of the final round module are the encrypted state.

Module expand_key_128:
- The expand_key_128 module generates round keys from a master key input.
- It takes in a clock signal, master key input, and Rcon (round constant) input.
- It generates round keys using a combination of shift operations, XOR operations, and table lookups.
- The generated round keys are output as out_1 and out_2.

Module one_round:
- The one_round module performs one round of AES encryption.
- It takes in a clock signal, state input, key input, and produces a new state output.
- The state and key inputs are used in table_lookup modules to perform table lookups.
- The table lookups involve XOR operations and table lookups using S-boxes.
- The XOR operations involve XORing the table lookup results with round keys.

Module final_round:
- The final_round module performs the final round of AES encryption.
- It takes in a clock signal, state input, key input, and produces a new state output.
- It also includes table lookup modules that perform table lookups using S4 operations.

Explanation:
Based on the provided design, there is no clear evidence of a hardware Trojan. However, a thorough analysis of
