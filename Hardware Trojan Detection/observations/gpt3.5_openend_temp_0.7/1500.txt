Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis:
- module aes_128: This module implements the AES encryption algorithm. It takes input of state and key, performs key expansion and multiple rounds of encryption, and produces the encrypted output. From a security perspective, AES is a well-studied and widely-used encryption algorithm, and if implemented correctly, it provides strong security against known attacks.
- module expand_key_128: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into round keys that are used in the encryption process. It uses a key expansion algorithm that involves a series of XOR and substitution operations. The output round keys are used in each round of the AES encryption algorithm. From a security perspective, the key expansion process is crucial for the strength of the encryption, and if implemented correctly, it should not introduce any vulnerabilities.
- module one_round: This module performs one round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes the input state and key, performs substitution and permutation operations, and produces the output state. From a security perspective, each round of AES
