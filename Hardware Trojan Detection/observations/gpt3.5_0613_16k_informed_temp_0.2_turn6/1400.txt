Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a 128-bit state and key, and outputs the encrypted state. The module also includes sub-modules for key expansion and multiple rounds of encryption.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the original key into multiple round keys. It takes in the original key and outputs two round keys. The key expansion process involves XOR operations and substitution operations.

- one_round module: This module performs one round of AES encryption. It takes in the state and a round key, and outputs the updated state for the next round. The round consists of substitution, permutation, and XOR operations.

- final_round module: This module performs the final round of AES encryption. It takes in the state and the last round key, and outputs the final encrypted state.

Hardware Trojan: No

Explanation: There is no hardware trojan in the design. The design implements the AES encryption algorithm without any malicious modifications or additional functionality.
