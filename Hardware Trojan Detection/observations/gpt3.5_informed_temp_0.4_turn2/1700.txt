Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, key, and outputs the encrypted output. The module consists of various sub-modules that perform different rounds of encryption. From a security perspective, the AES algorithm is considered secure and has been extensively analyzed and tested.
- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into a set of round keys used in the AES encryption process. It takes in a clock signal, input key, and a round constant (rcon) and outputs two sets of round keys. The module performs basic operations like XOR and bit shifting to generate the round keys. From a security perspective, the key expansion process is an important part of the AES algorithm and has been thoroughly analyzed and tested.
Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm and the key expansion process, both of which are well-known and widely used in secure systems.
