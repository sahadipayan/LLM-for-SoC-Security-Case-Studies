Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis:
- module top: This module is the top-level module that instantiates the AES-128 module, module1, and module2. It does not have any security vulnerabilities or trojans.
- module aes_128: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, and key as inputs, and produces the encrypted output. It uses various sub-modules to perform key expansion and multiple rounds of encryption. There are no security vulnerabilities or trojans in this module.
- module expand_key_128: This module is responsible for expanding the key used in the AES encryption. It takes in the original key and produces two sets of keys. It uses a shift register and XOR operations to generate the expanded keys. There are no security vulnerabilities or trojans in this module.
- module module2: This module takes in a clock signal, reset signal, key, and w1 as inputs. It contains a shift register (SECRETKey) and a counter (COUNTER). It uses the inputs to update the SECRETKey and generate INV1_out to INV11_out signals. There are no security vulnerabilities or trojans in this module.
- module module1: This module takes in a reset signal, encrypted output (out), and produces a signal w1. It contains a counter (Counter) that increments with each clock cycle. When the counter reaches a specific value, w1 is set to 1. There are no security vulnerabilities or trojans in this module.
- module one_round: This module performs one round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state_in, key, and produces the updated state_out. It uses table_lookup and XOR operations to update the state. There are no security vulnerabilities or trojans in this module.
- module final_round: This module performs the final round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state_in, key_in, and produces the final encrypted state_out. It uses S4 sub-modules and XOR operations to update the state. There are no security vulnerabilities or trojans in this module.
Explanation: There are no hardware trojans in the design. All the modules perform their intended functions without any malicious behavior.
