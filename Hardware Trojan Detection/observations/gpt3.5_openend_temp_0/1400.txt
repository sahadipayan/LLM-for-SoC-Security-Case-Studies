Hardware Trojan: No

Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes a clock signal, state, key as inputs and produces the encrypted output (out) and round keys (rk1-rk8) as outputs. The module uses a combination of XOR operations and key expansion to perform the encryption. From a security perspective, the module appears to be implementing the AES algorithm correctly.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys. It takes a clock signal, input key (in), round constant (rcon) as inputs and produces two round keys (out_1 and out_2) as outputs. The module uses XOR operations and key scheduling to generate the round keys. From a security perspective, the module appears to be correctly implementing the key expansion process.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design appears to be implementing the AES encryption algorithm correctly and does not contain any malicious or unauthorized functionality.
