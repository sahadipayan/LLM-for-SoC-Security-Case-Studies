Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, and key as inputs, and produces the encrypted output (out). The module uses various sub-modules to perform the different rounds of the AES algorithm.
- expand_key_128 module: This module expands the input key into a set of round keys. It takes in the clock signal, input key, and a round constant (rcon) as inputs, and produces two sets of round keys (out_1 and out_2) as outputs. The module uses a shift register and XOR operations to generate the round keys.
- lfsr_counter module: This module implements a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) counter. It takes in a reset signal, clock signal, a control signal (w1), and a 128-bit data input. It produces a 20-bit LFSR counter as output. The module uses XOR operations and shift operations to generate the LFSR counter.
- module2 module: This module takes in a reset signal, clock signal, control signal (w1), key, and data as inputs, and produces a 64-bit load signal as output. The module uses the LFSR counter to generate the load signal by XORing specific bits of the key with the counter.
- module1 module: This module takes in a reset signal and state as inputs, and produces a control signal (w1) as output. The module sets the control signal to 1 when specific values of the state are detected.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm and includes modules for key expansion, LFSR counter, and control signal generation. The design does not include any malicious or unauthorized functionality.
