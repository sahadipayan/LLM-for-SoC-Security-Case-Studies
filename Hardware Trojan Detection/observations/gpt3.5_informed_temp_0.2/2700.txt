Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes inputs of clk, rst, state, and key, and produces the output out. The module consists of submodules such as expand_key_128, one_round, and final_round, which perform different operations of the AES algorithm.
- expand_key_128 module: This module expands the input key into multiple round keys using the AES key schedule. It takes inputs of clk, in, rcon, and produces outputs out_1 and out_2. The module consists of submodules such as S4, which performs table lookups and XOR operations.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES algorithm. It takes inputs of clk, state_in, key, and produces the output state_out. The module consists of submodules such as table_lookup, which performs table lookups and XOR operations.
- final_round module: This module performs the final round of the AES algorithm. It takes inputs of clk, state_in, key_in, and produces the output state_out. The module consists of submodules such as S4, which performs table lookups and XOR operations.
- module1 module: This module implements a counter that increments on each clock cycle. It takes inputs of clk, rst, and produces the output w2.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm and consists of various modules that perform different operations of the algorithm. The modules are designed to perform their intended functions without any malicious behavior.
