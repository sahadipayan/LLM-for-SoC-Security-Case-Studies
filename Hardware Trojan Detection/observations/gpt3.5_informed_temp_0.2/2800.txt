Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes a clock signal, reset signal, state input, and key input, and produces an output. The module consists of several sub-modules, including expand_key_128, one_round, and final_round. The security of this module depends on the security of the AES algorithm itself.
- expand_key_128 module: This module expands the input key into multiple round keys using the AES key schedule. It takes a clock signal, input key, and rcon (round constant) as inputs, and produces two output round keys. The security of this module depends on the security of the AES key schedule algorithm.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes a clock signal, state input, key input, and produces a state output. The security of this module depends on the security of the AES round function.
- final_round module: This module performs the final round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes a clock signal, state input, key input, and produces a state output. The security of this module depends on the security of the AES final round function.
- module1 module: This module is not directly related to the AES encryption algorithm and does not have any security implications.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design implements the AES encryption algorithm and its sub-modules, which are commonly used and well-studied cryptographic components.
