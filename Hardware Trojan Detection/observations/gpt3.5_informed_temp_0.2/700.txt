Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, and key as inputs, and produces the encrypted output in the out signal. The module uses various sub-modules to perform the different rounds of the AES algorithm.
- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into round keys for each round of the AES algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, input key, and a round constant as inputs, and produces two sets of round keys as outputs. The module uses a shift register and XOR gates to perform the key expansion.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, input state, round key, and produces
