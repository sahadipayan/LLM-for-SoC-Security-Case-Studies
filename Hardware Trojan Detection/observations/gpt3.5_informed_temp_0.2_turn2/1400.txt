Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes in a clock signal, state, key, and outputs the encrypted output and round keys. The module does not have any security vulnerabilities or weaknesses.
- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys. It takes in a clock signal, input key, and round constant, and outputs two round keys. The module does not have any security vulnerabilities or weaknesses.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design consists of two modules, aes_128 and expand_key_128, which implement the AES-128 encryption algorithm and key expansion. These modules do not contain any malicious or unauthorized functionality.
