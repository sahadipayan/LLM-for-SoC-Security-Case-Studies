Hardware Trojan: No

Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES encryption algorithm. It takes in the clock signal, reset signal, state, key, and outputs the encrypted output. The state and key are XORed together and stored in s0 and k0 registers respectively. The expand_key_128 module is then instantiated to generate the round keys. The one_round module is instantiated 9 times to perform 9 rounds of encryption. Finally, the final_round module is instantiated to perform the last round of encryption. The output is assigned to the out2 wire and then assigned to the out wire with some additional logic.

- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the original key into multiple round keys. It takes in the clock signal, input key, and rcon value. It outputs two round keys, out_1 and out_2. The input key is split into four 32-bit words (k0, k1, k2, k3). The rcon value is XORed with the most significant byte of k0 to generate v0. v1, v2, and v3 are generated by XORing the previous v value with the corresponding k value. The k values are updated on the positive edge of the clock. The S4 module is instantiated to generate k4a, which is then XORed with k0a, k1a, k2a, and k3a to generate k0b, k1b, k2b, and k3b respectively. The round keys are updated on the positive edge of the clock.

- one_round module: This module performs one round of AES encryption. It takes in the clock signal, state_in, key, and outputs the updated state_out. The state_in and key are split into four 32-bit words (s0, s1, s2, s3 and k0, k1, k2, k3). The table_lookup module is instantiated four times to perform table lookups on each word. The results are XORed with the corresponding k value and assigned to z0, z1, z2, and z3. The state_out is updated on the positive edge of the clock.

- final_round module: This module performs the final round of AES encryption. It takes in the clock signal, state_in, key_in, and outputs the updated state_out. The state_in and key_in are split into four 32-bit words (s0, s1, s2, s3 and k0, k1, k2, k3). The S4 module is instantiated four times to perform S-Box substitutions on each word. The results are XORed with the corresponding k value and assigned to z0, z1, z2, and z3. The state_out is updated on the positive edge of the clock.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design.
