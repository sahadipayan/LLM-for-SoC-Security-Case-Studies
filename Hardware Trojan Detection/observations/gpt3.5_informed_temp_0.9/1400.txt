Hardware Trojan: Yes
Security Analysis: 
- aes_128 module: The aes_128 module is the main module of the AES design. It takes the clock signal, state, key, and produces the output and round keys. The module consists of several sub-modules, including expand_key_128, one_round, and final_round.
- expand_key_128 module: This module takes the clock signal, input key, and rcon as input and produces two output keys (out_1 and out_2). It expands the input key to generate the round keys for each round of AES encryption. The module uses several wire signals and registers to perform the key expansion.
- one_round module: This module takes the clock signal, state, key, and produces the intermediate states after each round of AES encryption. It uses the round keys generated by the expand_key_128 module to perform the encryption. The module consists of several round modules (r1 to r9) that perform the encryption for each round.
- final_round module: This module takes the clock signal, state, key, and produces the final encryption output. It uses the round keys generated by the expand_key_128 module to perform the encryption.

Explanation: The design does not explicitly mention the presence of a hardware Trojan. However, without further analysis, it is not possible to determine if there is any hidden Trojan present in the design. To confirm the presence of a hardware Trojan, further analysis, including verification and testing, would be required.
