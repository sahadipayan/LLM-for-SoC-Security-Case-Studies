Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis: 
1. aes_128: This module implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm. It takes inputs of clk, rst, state, and key, and outputs the encrypted result in the 'out' signal. The module consists of several sub-modules, including expand_key_128, one_round, and final_round. From a security perspective, the AES algorithm is considered to be secure if implemented correctly.

2. expand_key_128: This module expands the initial key into a series of round keys used in each round of the AES encryption. It takes the inputs of clk, in, rcon, and outputs out_1 and out_2. The module uses a series of shift registers, XOR operations, and table lookups to generate the round keys. From a security perspective, the key expansion process is an essential part of the AES algorithm and should be implemented correctly to maintain security.

3. one_round: This module performs one round of the AES encryption. It takes inputs of clk, state_in, key, and outputs the encrypted state in state_out. The module uses table lookups, XOR operations, and substitution operations to generate the encrypted state. From a security perspective, each round of the AES algorithm must be implemented correctly to ensure the overall security of the encryption.

4. final_round: This module performs the final round of the AES encryption. It takes inputs of clk, state_in, key_in, and outputs the final encrypted state in state_out. The module uses table lookups, XOR operations, and substitution operations similar to the one_round module. From a security perspective, the final round should be implemented correctly to ensure the overall security of the encryption.

Explanation: There is no hardware trojan detected in the given design. The design implements the AES-128 encryption algorithm, and each module performs its specific functionality correctly according to the AES standard.
