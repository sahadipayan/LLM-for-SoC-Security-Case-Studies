Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis:
- aes_128 module: This module implements the AES encryption algorithm. From a security perspective, AES is considered a secure encryption algorithm. However, it is important to ensure that the implementation of AES is correct and that there are no vulnerabilities or side-channel attacks that can be exploited.
- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for generating the round keys used in AES encryption. It takes the original key as input and expands it into a series of round keys. From a security perspective, the key expansion process needs to be secure to ensure that the generated round keys do not leak any information about the original key.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of AES encryption. It takes the state and round key as input and produces the intermediate state for the next round. From a security perspective, it is important to ensure that the operations performed in this module are correct and secure, without any vulnerabilities or side-channel attacks.
- final_round module: This module performs the final round of AES encryption. It takes the state and final round key as input and produces the encrypted output. From a security perspective, it is important to ensure that the final round is implemented correctly and securely, without any vulnerabilities or side-channel attacks.
- lfsr_counter module: This module implements a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) counter. It generates a pseudo-random sequence of bits based on an initial state. From a security perspective, the security of the LFSR counter depends on the quality of the pseudo-random sequence it generates. If the LFSR counter is used to generate any sensitive information, it is important to ensure that the generated sequence is unpredictable and secure.

Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design. The design consists of modules that implement the AES encryption algorithm and a LFS
