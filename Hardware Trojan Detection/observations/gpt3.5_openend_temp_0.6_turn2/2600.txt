Hardware Trojan: No
Security Analysis:
- expand_key_128 module: This module is responsible for expanding the input key into multiple round keys. It takes the input key and a round constant as inputs and generates two sets of round keys as outputs. The security of this module depends on the strength of the key expansion algorithm. If the key expansion algorithm is secure, then the module is secure.
- one_round module: This module performs one round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes the input state and round key as inputs and produces the output state. The security of this module depends on the security of the AES encryption algorithm. If the AES algorithm is secure, then the module is secure.
- final_round module: This module performs the final round of the AES encryption algorithm. It takes the input state and round key as inputs and produces the output state. The security of this module also depends on the security of the AES encryption algorithm. If the AES algorithm is secure, then the module is secure.
- module1 module: This module is a simple counter circuit. It increments the value of the counter whenever a specific condition is met. There is no security concern related to this module as it does not have any impact on the security of the AES encryption algorithm.
Explanation: There is no hardware Trojan in the design.
